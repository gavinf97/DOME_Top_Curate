  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this work was primarily sourced from openly accessible public repositories. The data was collected from the Conserved Domain Database, using specific keywords to identify relevant protein domains. Initially, 477 protein domains were gathered, which were then manually curated and filtered to obtain a refined set of 261 protein domains.\n\nThe dataset for training and testing the lifestyle classification model consisted of 1,057 phages from six different families: Inoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Tectiviridae, across 55 host genera. These phages had known genome and lifestyle information. The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a 60:40 ratio, resulting in 634 phages in the training set and 423 phages in the testing set.\n\nThe data used were solely for research purposes and were not utilized for any other noncommercial or commercial purposes. The datasets supporting the results of this article are available in the GitHub repository, along with up-to-date tutorials. Snapshots of the code and other supporting data are also available in the GigaScience repository, GigaDB. The example data used in this study can be found in the release branch called “Example data” or “Example data.zip” within the repository.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this work consisted of 1,057 phages from six different families: Inoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Tectiviridae, across 55 host genera. This dataset was randomly split into two main sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set contained 634 phages, while the testing set had 423 phages. This resulted in a 60:40 split ratio. The testing set was fully set aside for subsequent descriptions related to model training and development. The training set was used to generate a list of all possible 6-frame translation sequences that were at least 40 amino acids long. HMMER3 was then employed to search for the presence or absence of various protein domains, resulting in a vector for each phage describing the presence (1) or absence (0) of each domain. This information allowed for the filtering of the initial set of 477 putative useful protein domains down to the final set of 261.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in our study consisted of 1,057 phages from six different families, spanning 55 host genera, with known genome and lifestyle information. To ensure robust model training and evaluation, the dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets with a 60:40 ratio. This resulted in 634 phages in the training set and 423 phages in the testing set.\n\nThe testing set was fully set aside during the model training and development phases to maintain independence. This independence was crucial for obtaining unbiased performance metrics. The random split ensured that the distribution of phages across different families and host genera was representative in both the training and testing sets, mirroring the diversity found in previously published machine learning datasets focused on phage genomics.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and testing sets, we did not use any data from the testing set during the model training process. This included hyperparameter tuning and model selection, where only the training set was used. The testing set was exclusively used for final model evaluation to assess its generalizability and performance on unseen data. This approach helped in validating the model's robustness and reliability in classifying phage lifestyles accurately.",
  "dataset/availability": "In our study, we ensured that all data used were openly accessible from public repositories and released under open-source licenses. This approach aligns with our commitment to transparency and reproducibility in research.\n\nThe datasets supporting the results of this article are available in the GitHub repository. This repository contains the data used as examples, which can be found in the release branch called “Example data” or “Example data.zip.” Additionally, the GitHub repository includes up-to-date tutorials to guide users through the data and its applications.\n\nTo further support our work, snapshots of our code and other relevant data are openly available in the GigaScience repository, GigaDB. This ensures that all necessary information is accessible to the scientific community for verification and further research.\n\nAll data were used solely for research purposes, and we confirm that they were not utilized for any noncommercial or commercial purposes beyond the scope of this study. This adherence to ethical data use practices was enforced through rigorous documentation and compliance with open-source licensing agreements.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work leverages a random forest classifier. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets. The random forest classifier was chosen for its effectiveness in classifying temperate and lytic phages using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.\n\nThe algorithm used is not new; it is a widely recognized and extensively used method in the field of machine learning. The decision to use this established algorithm was driven by its proven performance in similar biological data analysis tasks. The focus of our publication is on the application of this algorithm to phage genomic analysis, rather than the development of a new machine-learning technique.\n\nGiven that the random forest classifier is a mature and well-documented method, publishing it in a machine-learning journal would not add significant value. Instead, our work emphasizes the innovative application of this algorithm to phage genomics, providing new insights and tools for the scientific community. The algorithm's implementation and performance are thoroughly evaluated within the context of phage lifestyle prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability in this specific domain.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically a random forest classifier. This classifier is trained and tested using a dataset consisting of 1,057 phages from various families and host genera, with known genome and lifestyle information. The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 60:40 ratio, ensuring that the testing set is fully set aside during the model training and development phases.\n\nThe random forest classifier incorporates conserved protein domains to classify temperate and lytic phages using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. The model's performance is evaluated by comparing it with other published tools using the same dataset. The lifestyle prediction function achieved the lowest error rates across all tested datasets, substantially outperforming existing tools for phage lifestyle classification.\n\nCross-validation is employed to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, and the \"best\"-performing model is selected based on the highest minimum accuracy across independent validation set tests. The parameters of this model are then refitted to the entire training set data, resulting in the final model. This approach ensures that the training data is independent and that the model's performance is robust and reliable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, a search was conducted in the Conserved Domain Database to collect protein domains from temperate phages. Relevant protein domains were identified using specific keywords such as \"temperate,\" \"lysogen,\" \"integrase,\" \"excisionase,\" \"recombinase,\" \"transposase,\" \"parA | parB,\" and \"xerC | xerD.\" This search yielded 477 protein domains, which underwent manual curation and filtration to ensure minimal domain length and validation against existing experimental data, resulting in a refined set of 261 protein domains.\n\nNext, a lifestyle classification model was trained and tested using a published dataset consisting of 1,057 phages from six different families across 55 host genera. The dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets with a 60:40 ratio. For each genome sequence in the training set, all possible 6-frame translation sequences that were at least 40 amino acids long were generated. HMMER3 was then used to search for the presence or absence of the various protein domains, resulting in a vector for each phage describing the presence (1) or absence (0) of each domain. This information allowed for the filtering of the initial set of 477 putative useful protein domains down to the final set of 261.\n\nSubsequently, a random forest classifier was fitted to the training set of phage genomes, and cross-validation was employed to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. The best-performing model was selected by choosing the hyperparameters that yielded the highest minimum accuracy across the independent validation set tests. The parameters of that model were then refitted to the entire training set data, resulting in the final model.\n\nFor the phylogenetic analysis, k-mer features were generated from the genome sequences. Each k-mer sequence was normalized by its row total to establish a representative probability distribution. The Jensen–Shannon divergence was then employed to estimate genome pairwise distances. The resulting distance matrix was used as input for a clustering algorithm to summarize the relatedness of the phage genomes and construct a phylogenetic tree. This approach ensured robust and accurate phylogenetic relationships, even for genome sequences exhibiting genetic recombinations and rearrangements.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilized a specific set of parameters to ensure optimal performance. The selection of these parameters was a meticulous process that involved several stages of refinement.\n\nInitially, a broad range of potential parameters was considered, which were then narrowed down through a series of cross-validation tests. These tests helped in identifying the most relevant parameters that contributed significantly to the model's accuracy. The final set of parameters, denoted as p, was chosen based on their ability to yield the highest minimum accuracy across independent validation set tests.\n\nThe process involved fitting a random forest classifier to the training set of phage genomes and employing cross-validation to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. The \"best\"-performing model was selected by choosing the hyperparameters that provided the highest accuracy. These parameters were then refitted to the entire training set data, resulting in the final model with the optimal set of parameters.\n\nThe number of parameters, p, used in the model was determined through this rigorous selection process, ensuring that only the most effective parameters were included. This approach helped in creating a robust and efficient model for phage genomic analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the lifestyle prediction model are derived from conserved protein domains. Initially, 477 protein domains were collected using specific keywords related to temperate phages. These domains underwent manual curation and filtration, resulting in a refined set of 261 protein domains. These 261 domains serve as the input features for the model.\n\nFeature selection was performed during the initial collection and refinement process. The domains were filtered based on criteria such as minimal domain length greater than 30 and validation in existing experimental data. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data during testing.\n\nThe final set of 261 protein domains was used to generate vectors for each phage, describing the presence or absence of each domain. This information was crucial in training the random forest classifier and fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters. The use of these selected features allowed for accurate classification of phage lifestyles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the feature selection process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved a random forest classifier, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. The number of parameters in our model was indeed larger than the number of training points, as we were dealing with a comprehensive set of protein domains derived from phage genomes.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, we utilized cross-validation. Specifically, we employed cross-validation to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. This process involved splitting the training data into multiple subsets and training the model on different combinations of these subsets while validating on the remaining data. By doing so, we ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.\n\nAdditionally, we selected the \"best\"-performing model by choosing the hyperparameters that yielded the highest minimum accuracy across the independent validation set tests. This approach further helped in mitigating over-fitting by ensuring that the model generalized well to new data.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, we carefully curated and filtered the initial set of protein domains, resulting in a refined set of 261 domains. This refinement process ensured that the features used in the model were relevant and informative, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Furthermore, the use of a random forest classifier, which aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees, provided a robust framework that minimized the risk of under-fitting.\n\nIn summary, our fitting method involved a combination of cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and careful feature selection to address both over-fitting and under-fitting, ensuring a well-generalized model.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent system designed to provide clear insights into its decision-making process. We utilized a random forest classifier, which is inherently interpretable due to its structure of multiple decision trees. Each tree in the random forest can be individually examined to understand how specific features contribute to the final prediction.\n\nFor instance, the model was trained to classify bacteriophage lifestyles (temperate or lytic) based on the presence or absence of conserved protein domains. The features used in the model include domains such as \"temperate,\" \"lysogen,\" \"integrase,\" \"excisionase,\" \"recombinase,\" \"transposase,\" \"parA | parB,\" and \"xerC | xerD.\" By analyzing the importance of these features within the random forest, one can discern which protein domains are most indicative of a temperate or lytic lifestyle. This transparency allows users to understand the biological significance behind the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 1,057 phages, and the results were compared with other published tools. The model achieved high classification accuracy, demonstrating its reliability and the robustness of its interpretability. Users can explore the model's decisions by examining the feature importance scores, which indicate the contribution of each protein domain to the classification outcome. This level of transparency is crucial for building trust in the model's predictions and for facilitating further biological research.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is a classification model. Specifically, it is designed to predict the lifestyle of bacteriophages, categorizing them as either temperate or lytic. This classification is achieved using a random forest classifier that incorporates conserved protein domains. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy in correctly identifying the phage lifestyle across various datasets. The output of the model provides probabilities for each classification, indicating the likelihood of a phage being either temperate or lytic. For instance, the model predicts that certain phages, such as Klebsiella phage KP36, are highly likely to be lytic with a probability of 99.3%, while others, like NC_017985, are predicted to be temperate with a probability of 100%. This classification is crucial for understanding phage ecosystems and designing effective phage therapy strategies. The model's outputs are presented in tables and visualizations, allowing users to easily interpret the results and gain insights into the phage lifestyles.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for generating phylogenetic trees using our tool, PhageGE, is significantly efficient compared to traditional multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based approaches. For instance, on a server with a 2-GHz CPU and 64-GB RAM, PhageGE took approximately 0.22 minutes to generate a phylogenetic tree for 15 phage genomes and about 4.42 minutes for 146 phage genomes. In contrast, the MSA-based approach, which utilizes tools like MAFFT and FastTree, required 30 minutes for 15 phage genomes and 296 minutes for 146 phage genomes. This demonstrates that PhageGE not only provides accurate phylogenetic analysis but also offers a substantial improvement in runtime efficiency, making it a more practical tool for large-scale genomic studies.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for PhageGE is publicly available and can be accessed via the project's GitHub repository. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and compatible with major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. It operates on various operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and MacOS.\n\nPhageGE is released under the MIT license, which permits free use, modification, and distribution of the software, provided that the original copyright and license notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nIn addition to the source code, PhageGE offers a web server platform that facilitates phage genomic analysis.

Snapshots of the code and additional supporting data are also openly available in the GigaScience repository, GigaDB. This ensures that users have access to up-to-date resources for conducting phage genomic analyses.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved several rigorous steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, we conducted a search in the Conserved Domain Database to collect protein domains from temperate phages. Keywords such as \"temperate,\" \"lysogen,\" \"integrase,\" and others were used to identify relevant protein domains. From an initial collection of 477 protein domains, we performed careful manual curation and filtration, resulting in a refined set of 261 protein domains.\n\nA lifestyle classification model was then trained and tested using a published dataset consisting of 1,057 phages from six different families across 55 host genera. This dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets with a 60:40 ratio. For each genome sequence in the training set, we generated all possible 6-frame translation sequences that were at least 40 amino acids long.

The PhageGE lifestyle prediction function achieved the lowest error rates across all tested datasets, substantially outperforming existing tools for phage lifestyle classification. The prediction accuracy of PhageGE exceeded that of the most accurate existing tool, BACPHLIP. This evaluation demonstrates the high prediction accuracy of our method, providing key insights into phage ecosystems and enabling optimal design of phage therapy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our tool, we focused on classification accuracy as the primary performance metric. This metric is crucial for assessing how well our tool can correctly identify the lifestyle of bacteriophages, specifically distinguishing between temperate and lytic phages. We reported the error rates and corresponding classification accuracies across various datasets, demonstrating the tool's reliability and precision.\n\nThe error rates reported were 0%, 1.2%, 0.3%, and 2.5%, which translate to classification accuracies of 100%, 98.8%, 99.7%, and 97.5% respectively. These metrics are representative of the tool's performance and are comparable to those reported in the literature. For instance, our tool outperformed existing tools like BACPHLIP, which had prediction accuracies of 99.8%, 98.3%, 99.2%, and 96.5% respectively. This comparison highlights the robustness and superiority of our tool in phage lifestyle classification.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the tool using a dataset of 1,057 phages, ensuring that our performance metrics are comprehensive and applicable to a wide range of phage genomes. The use of a random forest classifier, incorporating up-to-date conserved protein domains, further enhances the tool's accuracy and reliability. This approach is in line with current best practices in the field, making our performance metrics both relevant and representative.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our tool, we conducted a comprehensive comparison with publicly available methods using benchmark datasets. Specifically, we assessed the performance of our lifestyle prediction function against other published tools using a dataset consisting of 1,057 phages. This dataset was curated from the literature and includes phages from six different families and 55 host genera, with known genome and lifestyle information.\n\nOur lifestyle prediction function, which is built on a random forest classifier incorporating up-to-date conserved protein domains, demonstrated superior performance. It achieved the lowest error rates across all tested datasets, with classification accuracies of 100%, 98.8%, 99.7%, and 97.5%. This significantly outperformed existing tools, including BACPHLIP, which had prediction accuracies of 99.8%, 98.3%, 99.2%, and 96.5% respectively.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our tool's genome annotation capabilities with simpler baselines, such as Pharokka, Phaster, and RAST. These pipelines use different databases for phage genome annotation, often resulting in varying annotations. To address this, we developed an annotation comparison function that generates interactive tables displaying comments and differing genome annotation information from these pipelines. This function allows users to track differences between the three pipelines, providing a more comprehensive annotation result.\n\nThe comparison involved generating lists of all possible 6-frame translation sequences for each genome in the training set, which were at least 40 amino acids long. HMMER3 was then used to search for the presence or absence of various protein domains, resulting in a vector for each phage describing the presence or absence of each domain. This process allowed us to filter the initial set of 477 putative useful protein domains down to a final set of 261.\n\nIn summary, our tool was rigorously evaluated against both complex and simpler baselines, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy in phage genome analysis. The comparison with publicly available methods and benchmark datasets underscores the reliability and effectiveness of our approach.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method, PhageGE, includes a comprehensive assessment of its performance metrics. We employed a dataset of 1,057 phages to evaluate the lifestyle prediction function. The results indicate that PhageGE achieved very low error rates across all tested datasets, with classification accuracies of 100%, 98.8%, 99.7%, and 97.5%. These metrics demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our method.\n\nTo ensure the statistical significance of our findings, we compared PhageGE with other published tools. The comparison showed that PhageGE outperformed existing tools, including BACPHLIP, which had prediction accuracies of 99.8%, 98.3%, 99.2%, and 96.5%. This superior performance was consistently observed across multiple datasets, providing strong evidence that PhageGE is a more accurate and reliable tool for phage lifestyle classification.\n\nWhile specific confidence intervals for the performance metrics are not explicitly stated, the consistent and significant improvement over existing tools suggests a high level of confidence in the results. The use of a large and diverse dataset of phages further supports the generalizability and reliability of our findings. Additionally, the implementation of cross-validation during model training and development helps to ensure that the results are not due to overfitting, further enhancing the confidence in the performance metrics.",
