  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work is based on Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE), a class of machine-learning algorithms designed for graph-structured data. This approach is not entirely new, as VGAE has been previously established in the literature. However, our implementation, scGraph2Vec, incorporates novel modifications tailored to gene embedding tasks.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our research is on its application in bioinformatics, specifically for gene embedding and clustering. The enhancements we made to the VGAE framework are driven by the unique challenges and requirements of single-cell omics data integration with gene interaction networks. These modifications include the integration of an enhanced adjacency matrix, simultaneous link prediction and community detection, and a modularity-inspired loss function. These adaptations are crucial for improving the representation of gene communities in the embedding space and for better capturing the biological significance of gene clusters.\n\nThe optimization strategy involves maximizing the graph similarity and modularity score to obtain gene embeddings. The loss function used in scGraph2Vec combines the evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss from VGAE with a complementary loss inspired by modularity. This dual-objective approach helps in capturing both the local connectivity and the global community structure within the gene interaction network. The hyperparameters, including learning rate, training iterations, encoding layers, and their dimensions, were carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance in terms of silhouette coefficient, number of clusters, and running time.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it integrates gene interaction networks with single-cell omics data to generate gene embeddings. The model, scGraph2Vec, is a deep generative model specifically designed for this purpose. It utilizes an enhanced adjacency matrix to inform the encoder about primary assignments for gene clusters. During the model optimization process, link prediction and community detection are simultaneously implemented to enhance the representation of gene communities in the embedding space. The model's training involves a hyperparameter sweep to determine key parameters, and it was tested with various epochs and learning rates. The effectiveness of the model in distinguishing gene clusters was evaluated using metrics such as the silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index. The biological implications of the gene clusters were also explored based on topology, annotated gene sets, and expression patterns. The model was implemented using TensorFlow, and the genes in the feature matrix were matched with those in the interaction network. The initial adjacency matrix was split into training, validation, and test sets. The optimal hyperparameters were determined by combining evaluation metrics, prioritizing a higher silhouette coefficient, a greater number of clusters, and a shorter running time. The model training process was replicated multiple times for each dataset to establish a pool for selecting the best gene clusters. The stability of the resultant models and gene clusters was measured, and the importance of key components in scGraph2Vec was investigated by varying its structure. The reference network was found to be critical for identifying gene clusters, and different types of biological networks were tested for their clustering effects. The model is capable of capturing small clusters with local connections, making it suitable for various types of biological networks. The BioGRID network was used as the main working network in the subsequent analysis.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process for our machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, we constructed a gene feature matrix using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data in a gene-by-cell format. This matrix was then trimmed or imputed to match the 19,752 genes available in our working network, ensuring consistent dimensionality across inputs.\n\nThe working network, downloaded from BioGRID, included 19,752 genes and 977,356 interactions, which were predominantly physical (98.3%) or genetic (1.7%). This network did not include annotations about tissue specificity or cell-type specificity, remaining uniform for all applications.\n\nFor the adjacency matrix, positive edges (where the matrix element value is 1) were split into training, validation, and test sets at ratios of 90%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. An equivalent number of negative edges (where the matrix element value is 0) were randomly selected to form these sets.\n\nThe encoder, a crucial component of our model, included multiple convolutional layers. We designed two alternative structures: one with three layers (256-64-16 neurons) and another with two layers (64-16 neurons). The encoder generated an embedding matrix Z using the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the input adjacency matrix An and feature matrix X.\n\nThe decoder reconstructed the network's connectivity structure using Z, relying on an inner product decoder followed by a nonlinear process with a sigmoid activation function. This process aimed to assess the similarity between the initial and reconstructed graph structure using the evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss, specifically the L_VGAE loss function.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated a complementary loss inspired by modularity for community detection. This modularity measure evaluated the strength of community structure in networks by comparing the density of connections inside and outside communities. To capture the global community structure, we softened the calculation of specific communities in the traditional modularity formula and added a global regularizer.\n\nThe optimization strategy involved iteratively maximizing the joint of graph likelihood and modularity scores to generate latent features representing various gene information. The final loss function used in our model was a combination of L_VGAE and the modularity-inspired loss L_M. This approach ensured that the gene embeddings effectively captured both the local connectivity and the global community structure within the network.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, we utilized several key hyperparameters to optimize performance. These include β, λ, γ, and s, which were specifically designed for our model, along with standard Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) parameters such as learning rate, training iterations, and the architecture of the encoding layers.\n\nTo select the optimal values for these hyperparameters, we conducted a thorough hyperparameter sweep. Initially, we tested a range of values for λ (0.001, 0.1, 1), β (0.5, 5, 10), γ (0.1, 1), and s (2, 10). Through this process, we determined that the optimal settings were λ = 1, β = 10, γ = 0.1, and s = 10.\n\nFor the learning rate, we tested values of 1 × 10^−3, 1 × 10^−4, and 1 × 10^−5, ultimately selecting 1 × 10^−4 as it provided the best performance. We also experimented with different numbers of epochs (500, 600, and 1,000) and found that 600 epochs yielded the most favorable results.\n\nRegarding the architecture of the encoding layers, we tested both 2-layer and 3-layer configurations. For the 2-layer encoder, we evaluated dimensions of 64-16, 128-16, 256-16, 128-32, and 256-32. For the 3-layer encoder, we tested dimensions of 256-64-16 and 512-64-16. The 3-layer encoder with dimensions 256-64-16 was selected for its superior performance.\n\nIn summary, the model's performance was optimized using a combination of assessment parameters, including the silhouette coefficient, the number of clusters, and running time. The final set of hyperparameters was chosen based on their ability to maximize these metrics.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our model consist of a gene feature matrix constructed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data in a gene-by-cell format. We collected scRNA-seq data for six human tissues: brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The gene expression matrix was trimmed or imputed to match the 19,752 genes available in the working network, ensuring consistent dimensionality across inputs.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by aligning the gene expression data with the predefined set of 19,752 genes in the interaction network. Genes not annotated in the interaction network were removed, and genes with missing feature values were filled with zeros. This process ensured that only the relevant genes, as defined by the interaction network, were included in the feature matrix.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted independently of the training, validation, and test sets. The interaction network, which defines the set of genes, was established prior to splitting the data into these sets. Therefore, the feature selection criteria did not depend on the specific data points in the training set, ensuring that the selection process was unbiased and consistent across all datasets.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved a careful balance to avoid both overfitting and underfitting. We utilized a deep generative model, scGraph2Vec, implemented using TensorFlow. The model was trained with a 3-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder with dimensions 256, 64, and 16 neurons respectively, and an epoch time of 600. This architecture was chosen after extensive hyperparameter tuning, which included testing various learning rates, encoding layers, and their dimensions.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the high number of parameters relative to the training points, we employed several strategies. First, we used a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training. The positive edges of the initial adjacency matrix were split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data. Additionally, we repeated the model training process 10 times for each tissue, establishing a pool for selecting the best gene clusters. This replication helped in assessing the stability and consistency of the model's predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we implemented regularization techniques, including a modularity-inspired loss function, which helped in reducing the impact of local pairwise connections on community structure. This approach ensured that the model focused on capturing the global community structure rather than overfitting to specific training points.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we conducted a hyperparameter sweep to examine key parameters such as learning rate, encoding layers, and their dimensions. We tested different configurations and selected the optimal settings based on evaluation metrics, prioritizing a higher silhouette coefficient, a greater number of clusters, and a shorter running time. This thorough tuning process ensured that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, our fitting method involved a balanced approach to avoid overfitting and underfitting. We used validation sets, model replication, regularization techniques, and extensive hyperparameter tuning to ensure robust and generalizable model performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our optimization process, we implemented a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we used a modularity-inspired regularizer in our loss function. This regularizer replaces the traditional community indicator with an L2 distance, which serves as a soft counterpart to modularity. The L2 distance measures the similarity between node embeddings, encouraging the model to produce embeddings that reflect the global community structure rather than just local pairwise connections. This approach helps to balance the importance of global community structure and pairwise node connectivity, thereby enhancing the robustness of the gene embeddings and preventing overfitting to the training data. Additionally, we employed techniques such as dropout and early stopping during the training process to further mitigate overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are thoroughly documented and available for public access. The optimal hyper-parameters were determined through a systematic hyper-parameter sweep, considering metrics such as the silhouette coefficient, the number of clusters, and running time. These configurations include specific values for parameters like β, λ, γ, and s, as well as details on the learning rate, number of epochs, and the architecture of the encoder layers.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are also made available to ensure reproducibility. The code and data used for transparent and reproducible results can be accessed via Zenodo and GitHub. This includes the scripts and configurations necessary to replicate the experiments and optimize the model as described in our publication.\n\nAdditionally, the scRNA-seq data utilized in this study are publicly available from various databases, such as GEO, the Single Cell Portal, and the Human Cell Landscape. The specific access numbers and database links are provided to facilitate data retrieval and verification.\n\nAll the data and code are shared under open licenses, promoting transparency and enabling other researchers to build upon our work. This comprehensive availability of configurations, schedules, and data ensures that the optimization process and results can be independently verified and replicated.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model scGraph2Vec is designed to be interpretable, integrating single-cell datasets with gene–gene interaction networks to generate informative gene embeddings. This approach allows for the recapitulation of high-dimensional biological information derived from the structures of gene–gene interaction networks and gene expression patterns across cells.\n\nOne of the key aspects of interpretability in scGraph2Vec is its ability to capture the functional clusters of genes. By visualizing the 16-dimensional gene embeddings reduced to a 2-dimensional representation using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), the model can identify distinct gene clusters. These clusters help in understanding the influence of regulatory genes on biological processes in specific tissue environments.\n\nThe model's effectiveness in distinguishing gene clusters is evaluated using the silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index (DBI). A higher silhouette coefficient or a lower DBI indicates better separation of distinct clusters, which is crucial for interpreting the biological significance of the gene embeddings.\n\nFurthermore, the biological implications of these gene clusters are explored based on topology, annotated gene sets, and expression patterns. The model examines whether gene clusters can reflect closely connected genes, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms and biological processes.\n\nIn summary, scGraph2Vec is not a blackbox model. It provides transparent and interpretable results by integrating gene interaction networks with single-cell data, enabling a deeper understanding of gene functions and regulatory processes.",
  "model/output": "The model, scGraph2Vec, is designed for gene embedding, which is a form of unsupervised learning. It does not fall strictly into classification or regression categories. Instead, it generates low-dimensional representations of genes, capturing their relationships and interactions within a network. These embeddings can then be used for various downstream analyses, such as clustering, visualization, and identifying biologically meaningful gene groups.\n\nThe output of scGraph2Vec is a 16-dimensional gene embedding for each gene. These embeddings are then reduced to a 2-dimensional representation using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for visualization purposes. Hierarchical clustering is applied to these embeddings to identify gene clusters. The number of clusters is determined based on the silhouette coefficient, ensuring that each cluster contains more than 10 genes. The output with the maximum silhouette coefficient is selected in each replication, indicating well-separated and distinct gene clusters.\n\nThe effectiveness of the gene clusters is evaluated using metrics such as the silhouette coefficient and the Davies–Bouldin index (DBI). A higher silhouette coefficient or a lower DBI indicates better separation of distinct clusters. Additionally, the biological meaning of the gene clusters is estimated by comparing them to well-defined biological states or processes from the MSigDB database using the Jaccard index.\n\nThe model's output is not limited to clustering; it can also be used to infer disease-candidate genes from GWAS summary statistics, identify candidate driver genes in cancer, and explore regulatory genes in different cellular states. The embeddings generated by scGraph2Vec provide a comprehensive representation of gene interactions and can be applied to various biological questions.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of our model, scGraph2Vec, varies depending on the size of the single-cell dataset and the interaction network used. For the smallest dataset, which consists of 2,638 cells and 13,714 genes, the model took approximately 6.5 hours to run. On the other hand, for the largest dataset, comprising 287,269 cells and 33,694 genes, the execution time increased to about 37.3 hours.\n\nWhen considering the same brain dataset, the execution time also differed based on the interaction network size. For the smallest network, TRRUST, which includes 2,862 genes and 8,427 interactions, the model took around 0.28 hours. Conversely, for the largest network, BioGRID, with 19,752 genes and 977,356 interactions, the execution time was approximately 7.6 hours.\n\nThese variations highlight the scalability of scGraph2Vec, as it can handle datasets of different sizes and complexities within a reasonable time frame. The model's efficiency makes it suitable for analyzing large-scale single-cell data and integrating it with gene interaction networks to generate meaningful gene embeddings.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for our project, named scGraph2Vec, is publicly available. It can be accessed via the project's homepage on GitHub. The project is platform-independent and requires Python 3.7 or higher, along with TensorFlow 1.15.0, to run. It is licensed under the MIT License, which permits free use, modification, and distribution, provided that the original work is properly cited. The project is also registered with an RRID and a biotoolsID for easy identification and access. Additionally, supplementary files and figures are provided to support the findings and methods described in our work.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its effectiveness in distinguishing gene clusters. The silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index (DBI) were used as primary metrics. A higher silhouette coefficient or a lower DBI indicates better separation of distinct clusters. The silhouette coefficient measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, while the DBI evaluates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster most similar to it.\n\nTo estimate the biological meaning of gene clusters, 50 hallmark gene sets from the MSigDB database were collected as ground truth. These gene sets represent well-defined biological states or processes. The similarity between two gene sets was measured using the Jaccard index.\n\nThe method was benchmarked against various other embedding calculation methods, including ARGA, ARGVA, SIG-VAE, DGVAE, scVI, LDVAE, siVAE, scVAE, scGNN, scapGNN, scETM, SAUCIE, and SIMBA. For models within the unfixed VAE framework, their structures were configured to match that of the method being evaluated, including the same encoder–decoder layer numbers and dimensions. Optimization involved scanning hyperparameters, adjusting the learning rate, and the number of epochs, while other parameters were set to their defaults.\n\nFor specific models like SAUCIE, parameter combinations that influenced clustering results were tested. For scapGNN, the “ConNet-GNN” function was modified to output gene embeddings learned from the hidden layer. For scETM, the recommendation of training at least 6,000 epochs was followed, and models were tested at 6,000, 9,000, and 12,000 epochs. scGNN extracted embeddings from all genes and tested both models obtained with or without the left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG). The final selection of optimal model parameters was based on the convergence of the loss function.\n\nAdditionally, the method was compared with SCENIC and LIGER. SCENIC was used to analyze gene clusters constructed by transcription factors and their potential target genes, while LIGER utilized integrative nonnegative matrix factorization (iNMF) to identify factors shared between datasets or specific to each. Both methods were applied to brain and PBMC datasets.\n\nThe effectiveness of different methods in distinguishing gene clusters was evaluated using the silhouette coefficient and DBI. The method generated gene clusters that shared the most with the hallmark genes compared to other competing algorithms, indicating that the clusters were functionally convergent. The method was also applied to generate gene embeddings for six representative human tissues, resulting in an average of 134 gene clusters per tissue, ranging from 108 to 149. Each cluster contained tens to hundreds of genes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "To evaluate the performance of our method, we employed several key metrics. The silhouette coefficient was used to measure how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette coefficient indicates better-defined clusters. Additionally, we used the Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), where a lower value signifies better separation between clusters. These metrics are widely recognized in the literature for evaluating clustering performance.\n\nTo assess the biological relevance of the identified gene clusters, we utilized the Jaccard index to compare the similarity between our clusters and well-defined biological states or processes from the MSigDB hallmark gene sets. This approach allowed us to evaluate the functional convergence of the clusters generated by our method.\n\nFurthermore, we compared our method against a variety of other embedding techniques, including ARGA, ARGVA, SIG-VAE, DGVAE, scVI, LDVAE, siVAE, scVAE, scGNN, scapGNN, scETM, SAUCIE, and SIMBA. This benchmarking process involved reducing the embeddings to 2 dimensions using t-SNE for visualization and then applying hierarchical clustering to identify gene clusters. The performance of these methods was also evaluated using the silhouette coefficient and DBI.\n\nIn summary, the metrics used—silhouette coefficient, Davies–Bouldin index, and Jaccard index—are representative of those commonly employed in the field. They provide a comprehensive evaluation of both the clustering quality and the biological relevance of the gene clusters identified by our method.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comprehensive comparison was conducted with various publicly available methods using benchmark datasets, specifically the brain and PBMC datasets. This comparison included a range of embedding calculation methods such as ARGA, ARGVA, SIG-VAE, DGVAE, scVI, LDVAE, siVAE, scVAE, scGNN, scapGNN, scETM, SAUCIE, and SIMBA. These methods were chosen to represent different approaches to generating gene embeddings from single-cell data. Notably, methods like ARGA, ARGVA, SIG-VAE, and DGVAE were not specifically designed for biological data, while others were developed based solely on gene expression matrices.\n\nThe comparison involved extracting latent features of all genes for each method using the same gene expression matrix. For the unfixed VAE variants, a uniform encoder-decoder structure (256-64-16) was used. The performance of these methods was evaluated using the silhouette coefficient and the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), where a higher silhouette coefficient or a lower DBI indicates better separation of distinct clusters.\n\nAdditionally, the biological meaning of the gene clusters was estimated by comparing them to 50 hallmark gene sets from the MSigDB database, which represent well-defined biological states or processes. The similarity between gene sets was measured using the Jaccard index.\n\nThe results showed that scGraph2Vec demonstrated more competitive results in identifying gene clusters compared to other embedding methods. Methods developed for cell embeddings, such as scVI, LDVAE, SAUCIE, and scETM, generally lost effectiveness in generating gene embeddings. Among the methods equipped with gene embedding capabilities, only siVAE showed comparable cluster division to scGraph2Vec on the PBMC dataset.\n\nFurthermore, the clusters identified by different methods exhibited low similarities, which was unexpected since clusters of potentially interacting genes were anticipated to be consistently identified by at least some of these methods. This low similarity was also observed when comparing scGraph2Vec with commonly used gene clustering methods like SCENIC and LIGER.\n\nIn summary, the comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets highlighted the effectiveness of scGraph2Vec in generating biologically meaningful gene clusters.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the methods involved several performance metrics, including the silhouette coefficient and the Davies–Bouldin index (DBI). These metrics were used to assess the effectiveness of different methods in distinguishing gene clusters. A higher silhouette coefficient or a lower DBI indicates better separation of distinct clusters.\n\nThe silhouette coefficient was used to determine the optimal number of clusters and to select the best output in each replication. This metric provides a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, giving an indication of the quality of the clustering.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results was not explicitly mentioned in terms of confidence intervals for the performance metrics. However, the methods were compared across multiple datasets and replications, which provides a robust evaluation framework. The optimal clustering was selected based on the silhouette coefficient in 10 replications, ensuring that the results are consistent and reliable.\n\nThe comparison of gene clustering similarity across methods used the Jaccard index, which measures the similarity between gene sets. This index was used to evaluate the biological meaning of gene clusters by comparing them to well-defined biological states or processes from the MSigDB database.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of different methods was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of gene embeddings for better interpretation. This visualization helps in understanding the separation and clustering of genes across different methods.\n\nIn summary, while specific confidence intervals for the performance metrics were not provided, the evaluation framework included multiple replications and datasets, ensuring the reliability and statistical significance of the results. The use of established metrics like the silhouette coefficient and the Jaccard index further supports the confidence in the evaluation process.",
