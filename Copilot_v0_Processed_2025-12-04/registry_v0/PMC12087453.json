  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from patients who delivered full-term babies through C-sections at Kapioani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii, between 2016 and 2018. The cohort consists of 72 patients, reflecting the multiethnic population of Hawaii, including Asian, Caucasian, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. The dataset includes 38 healthy control samples and 34 samples from cases with prepregnancy maternal obesity.\n\nThe data generated in this study, including DNA methylation data and bulk RNA-seq data, have been submitted to the National Institutes of Health Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE273075. Additionally, other datasets used for analysis and validation purposes are publicly available. These include placenta datasets available in the GEO repository with accession numbers GSE31781, GSE36829, GSE59274, GSE44667, GSE74738, GSE49343, GSE69502, and GSE98224.

Supporting data, such as gestational DMR regions, obesity classification marker lists, and TCGA clinical information, are also available via the GigaScience database GigaDB.\n\nThe study utilized matched methylation, gene expression, and metabolomics data for a subset of 42 patients. Multiomics integration was performed using Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) implemented in the mixOmics package. This integration helped in identifying correlated consensus latent variables among different omics data in a supervised manner. The top features for each omic were selected based on loading values, and pathway-level interactions were integrated using pathview.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into training and testing sets for the obesity classification model. Specifically, 72 samples were divided into maternal obesity and control groups. The split ratio was 80/20, meaning 80% of the samples were used for training and 20% for testing. This split was performed with 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability of the model. The training set consisted of 57 samples, while the testing set had 15 samples. This approach helped in evaluating the model's performance effectively across different subsets of the data.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data generated in this study, including DNA methylation data and bulk RNA-seq data, have been submitted and are publicly available through the National Institutes of Health Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE273075. This ensures that the data is accessible to the scientific community for further analysis and validation.\n\nAdditionally, other datasets used in this project for analysis and validation purposes are also publicly available.

This comprehensive availability of data and supporting materials ensures transparency and reproducibility of the study's findings.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is the random forest classification model. This is a well-established ensemble learning method known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data, making it suitable for the complex multiomics integration analysis performed.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and validated in various fields, including genomics and bioinformatics. The choice to use this algorithm in this context is driven by its effectiveness in handling the specific challenges posed by the data, such as the need to integrate multiple omics modalities and the requirement for high predictive accuracy.\n\nThe decision to use a well-known algorithm like random forest, rather than a novel one, is likely due to its proven track record and reliability. Publishing in a machine-learning journal is not the primary goal of this study, which focuses on the biological and medical implications of maternal obesity on cancer risk. The use of a established algorithm ensures that the findings are robust and can be readily replicated by other researchers in the field.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically a random forest (RF) classifier. This RF model was constructed using hypermethylated CpG sites from the promoter regions of genes involved in significant pathways, which were identified through missMethyl KEGG enrichment results.\n\nThe RF model was trained on a dataset consisting of 72 maternal obesity and control samples, split at an 80/20 ratio with 5-fold cross-validation. This approach ensures that the training data is independent for each fold, maintaining the integrity of the model's performance evaluation.\n\nThe RF model was then applied to 14 TCGA datasets to perform cancer/normal sample prediction. The performance of the model was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1 score. This evaluation provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities across different cancer types.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Gene expression counts were calculated using featureCount from Subread. For differential expression analysis, the limma voom transformation was applied to model the mean-variance relationship of the log2 counts, supporting the empirical Bayes analysis pipeline in limma. Source-of-variance analysis was performed to identify clinical confounders, which included maternal age, baby sex, hemoglobin, sample group, net weight gain, maternal ethnicity, gravidity, and parity. These confounders were adjusted for in the differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 and limma-voom functions. P-values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment.\n\nFor methylation data, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between gene expression and methylation β-values from the promoter regions. Genes with a high negative correlation were used for pathway enrichment analysis. Top genes of interest were selected based on an absolute value fold change greater than 1.5 in gene expression and a gene-methylation correlation of less than -0.3 for hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites.\n\nMetabolomics data were acquired from a previously published study involving 87 patients. Targeted metabolites were generated with LC-MS, and untargeted metabolites were generated with GC-MS. After removing compounds missing in more than 10% of samples, a total of 185 metabolites remained. The raw metabolite data were log-transformed, standardized, normalized using variance stabilization normalization, and batch-corrected with the ComBat function in the sva package. Differential metabolites were identified by limma, with clinical confounder adjustment.\n\nFor multiomics integration, matched methylation, gene expression, and metabolomics data were available for a subset of 42 patients. The Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) implemented in the mixOmics package was applied. DIABLO finds the correlated consensus latent variables among different omics in a supervised manner. Top DIABLO features for each omic were selected based on the loading values. Pathway-level methylation, gene, and metabolite interactions were integrated using pathview.\n\nIn the evaluation of maternal prepregnancy obesity biomarkers in cancer prediction, Infinium HumanMethylation450 data were collected for 14 cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas. A total of 6,428 samples were obtained, consisting of 5,715 tumor samples and 713 adjacent normal tissues. To build the obesity classification model, 61 hypermethylated CpG sites from the promoter regions of genes involved in the top five significant pathways were selected. The data were split into training and testing sets with 5-fold cross-validation, and a series of classification methods were constructed using the lilikoi R package, with random forest being the winning model. This model was then applied to the 14 TCGA datasets to perform cancer/normal sample prediction, and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1 score.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the classification model were derived from hypermethylated CpG sites in the promoter regions of genes involved in specific pathways. A total of 61 hypermethylated CpG sites were selected from the promoter regions of genes in the top five significant pathways. These pathways include cell-cycle, ribosome, nucleocytoplasmic transport, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and mTOR signaling pathways.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training set only. The selection process involved identifying CpG sites that were hypermethylated and associated with the top pathways. This was done to ensure that the features used in the model were relevant and contributed to the classification of maternal obesity.\n\nThe selected features were then used to build a random forest classification model. This model was trained on a dataset of 72 samples, split into an 80/20 ratio with 5-fold cross-validation. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as balanced accuracy, overall accuracy, and F1 score. The results indicated that the model was effective in classifying maternal obesity and had potential applications in predicting cancer risk in offspring.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved several steps to ensure that both overfitting and underfitting were adequately addressed. The number of parameters in our models was indeed larger than the number of training points, particularly in the context of DNA methylation and RNA-seq data analysis. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we utilized a combination of techniques.\n\nFirstly, we performed a source-of-variation analysis using ANOVA tests to identify and adjust for confounding factors. This step helped in isolating the true biological signals from systematic biases. Additionally, we employed Bayesian methods to calculate genomic inflation values, which further ensured that the observed inflation reflected true biological signals rather than systematic bias.\n\nFor the differential methylation analysis, we used a moderated t-test from the \"limma\" R package, which is designed to handle the high dimensionality of methylation data. The P-values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. This approach helped in controlling the false positive rate and ensuring that the identified differentially methylated CpG sites were statistically significant.\n\nIn the context of RNA-seq data analysis, we applied the limma voom transformation to model the mean-variance relationship of the log2 counts. This transformation supports the empirical Bayes analysis pipeline in limma, which helps in stabilizing the variance and improving the accuracy of the differential expression analysis. We also performed a source-of-variation analysis to identify significant confounders and adjusted for them using the \"DESeq2\" and \"limma-voom\" functions.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of our models, we used cross-validation techniques. For example, in building the obesity classification model, we split the data into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80/20 and performed 5-fold cross-validation. This approach helped in assessing the generalizability of our models and ensuring that they were not overfitting to the training data.\n\nMoreover, we integrated multi-omics data using the Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) implemented in the mixOmics package. This method finds the correlated consensus latent variables among different omics data in a supervised manner, which helps in identifying robust biomarkers.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved rigorous statistical techniques and cross-validation strategies to address the challenges of high-dimensional data. These steps ensured that both overfitting and underfitting were minimized, leading to reliable and generalizable results.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method involved the use of random forest classification, which inherently helps to reduce overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees. This ensemble approach provides a more stable and generalizable model compared to a single decision tree.\n\nAdditionally, we performed stringent confounding adjustment using multivariate regression models implemented in the \"limma\" package. This step was crucial in eliminating potential biases from clinical factors such as maternal age, baby's sex, and gestational age, which could otherwise lead to spurious associations and overfitting.\n\nFor the multiomics integration, we utilized Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) from the mixOmics package. DIABLO identifies correlated consensus latent variables among different omics data, which helps in capturing the most relevant features and reducing the dimensionality of the data. This approach not only enhances the interpretability of the results but also mitigates the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most informative variables.\n\nFurthermore, we applied cross-validation techniques, specifically 5-fold cross-validation, during the model training process. This method involves splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on different subsets of the data. This practice helps in assessing the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting to a specific dataset.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated multiple regularization techniques, including random forest classification, confounding adjustment, multiomics integration with DIABLO, and cross-validation, to ensure robust and generalizable results while minimizing the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It leverages several transparent and interpretable methods to ensure clarity in its predictions and findings.\n\nOne of the key tools used is the DIABLO (Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents) framework, which is part of the mixOmics package. DIABLO facilitates multiomics integration by identifying correlated consensus latent variables among different omics data types in a supervised manner. This approach allows for the extraction of top features from each omic modality based on their loading values, making it easier to interpret which variables are most influential in the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilizes the Lilikoi R package for personalized pathway-based classification modeling. This package enables the identification of significant pathways and the visualization of important features, providing a clear understanding of the biological processes involved. For instance, the model highlights the top 25 features in methylation, gene expression, and metabolomics modalities, which contribute the most to the separation of obese and control samples. This transparency is crucial for validating the model's biological relevance and ensuring that the findings are interpretable and actionable.\n\nFurthermore, the use of pathway-level interactions through tools like pathview enhances the interpretability of the results. By integrating methylation, gene, and metabolite interactions at the pathway level, the model provides a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying maternal prepregnancy obesity and its intergenerational effects.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the use of interpretable methods and tools that highlight key features and pathways, ensuring that the predictions and findings are clear and biologically meaningful.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a random forest classification model designed to predict cancer types based on maternal obesity biomarkers. The model was built using hypermethylated CpG sites from the promoter regions of genes involved in significant pathways associated with maternal prepregnancy obesity. It was trained on a dataset of maternal obesity and control samples and then applied to predict cancer/normal sample labels in 14 different cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1 score. The results indicate that the model is effective in predicting certain cancer types, suggesting a potential link between maternal obesity and increased cancer risk in offspring through epigenetic modifications.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific analyses performed. For the differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, the limma voom transformation and subsequent empirical Bayes analysis were computationally intensive, but efficient due to the use of optimized algorithms. The source-of-variance analysis, which involved ANOVA tests to identify clinical confounders, was also time-consuming but necessary for accurate confounder adjustment.\n\nThe protein-protein interaction network analysis, which utilized the STRING database and PANDA for identifying significantly functionally associated protein pairs, required substantial computational resources. The visualization of the bipartite network graph using Cytoscape added to the overall execution time.\n\nThe multiomics integration using DIABLO in the mixOmics package was particularly demanding, as it involved integrating methylation, gene expression, and metabolomics data. This process required significant computational power and time to find the correlated consensus latent variables among the different omics datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the metabolomics data processing, including log-transformation, standardization, normalization, and batch correction, contributed to the overall execution time. The identification of differential metabolites using limma with clinical confounder adjustment further added to the computational load.\n\nOverall, the model's execution time was influenced by the complexity of the data and the computational requirements of the various analytical steps. While specific execution times are not provided, it is clear that the model involved extensive computational efforts to achieve the desired results.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our methods involved several rigorous steps to ensure the robustness and validity of our findings. We employed a combination of statistical analyses and computational techniques to assess the performance and significance of our results.\n\nFor the differential methylation analysis, we used the DESeq2 and limma-voom methods to identify statistically significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between healthy controls and maternally obese cases. We adjusted p-values for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR). This approach helped us to identify DMRs with adjusted p-values less than 0.05, ensuring that our findings were statistically significant.\n\nIn the correlation analysis between bulk RNA-seq and methylation data, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) to measure the relationship between gene expression and methylation β-values from the promoter regions. We focused on genes with a high negative correlation (PCC < -0.2), as a negative correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation in the promoter region is biologically expected. This allowed us to select genes of interest for pathway enrichment analysis using TOPPFUN.\n\nFor the metabolomics analysis, we identified differential metabolites by adjusting for clinical confounders using the limma package. This ensured that the identified metabolites were truly differential and not due to confounding variables.\n\nIn the multiomics integration, we applied the Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) method implemented in the mixOmics package. DIABLO finds the correlated consensus latent variables among different omics data in a supervised manner, allowing us to integrate pathway-level methylation, gene, and metabolite interactions using pathview.\n\nAdditionally, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the \"gometh\" function from the R package \"missMethyl\" to identify significant pathways associated with differential methylation sites. Pathways with adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. We also validated the enrichment of significant CpGs in specific pathways using the hypergeometric test.\n\nTo further validate our findings, we conducted a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) using the R package \"WGCNA.\" We constructed the weighted adjacency matrix with an adjusted R² > 0.8 and identified modules using the dynamic tree-cut algorithm. The networks were exported to Cytoscape for visualization, and hub genes were identified based on their betweenness and degree in the network.\n\nOverall, our evaluation methods combined statistical rigor with advanced computational techniques to ensure the reliability and biological relevance of our results.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, several performance metrics were reported to assess the effectiveness of our models and analyses. For the classification of TCGA cancers using the maternal obesity classification model, we utilized Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which provide a visual representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate. Additionally, we reported the Area Under the Curve (AUC), balanced accuracy, and F1 score for each cancer type. These metrics offer a comprehensive view of the model's performance, with balanced accuracy accounting for class imbalances and the F1 score providing a harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\nFor the multiomics integration analysis, we focused on the top features extracted from the embedding space, highlighting the most significant contributors to the separation of obese and control samples across methylation data, gene expression data, and metabolomics data. The importance plots of these top features visually demonstrate the condition-specific contributions, enhancing the interpretability of our findings.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring that our evaluation is robust and comparable to other studies in the field. The use of ROC curves, AUC, balanced accuracy, and F1 score aligns with common methodologies for assessing classification performance, particularly in biomedical research. This set of metrics provides a thorough evaluation of our models' ability to distinguish between different conditions and identify key biological features.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. For differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, we used the limma-voom transformation to model the mean-variance relationship, which supports the empirical Bayes analysis pipeline in limma. This approach helps in stabilizing the variance across the mean-intensity values, making the data more suitable for linear modeling. We also performed source-of-variance analysis using ANOVA tests to identify significant clinical confounders, which included maternal age, baby sex, hemoglobin, sample group, net weight gain, maternal ethnicity, gravidity, and parity. These confounders were adjusted using the DESeq2 and limma-voom functions, and p-values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. No significant differential genes were found with adjusted p-values < 0.05, indicating that the observed differences were not statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing.\n\nFor methylation data, we conducted a source-of-variation analysis to identify clinical factors contributing to methylation level variation. Variables with F statistics > 1 were considered confounders and were adjusted using a multivariate regression model built with the limma package. The genomic inflation factor (λ) was calculated using the Bayesian method \"bacon\" to assess bias and inflation in differential methylation findings. The null model λ was 0.96, and no surrogate variables were identified for correction, suggesting that the observed inflation reflects true biological signals rather than systematic bias.\n\nIn the correlation analysis between bulk RNA-seq and methylation data, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) were calculated, and genes with high negative correlations (PCC < -0.2) were used for pathway enrichment. The statistical significance of these correlations was not explicitly stated, but the use of a threshold (PCC < -0.2) implies a level of confidence in the observed relationships.\n\nFor metabolomics analysis, differential metabolites were identified using limma with clinical confounder adjustment. The statistical significance of these findings was not explicitly detailed, but the use of limma suggests that appropriate statistical methods were applied to control for false discoveries.\n\nIn summary, our study employed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the confidence and significance of our results. Confidence intervals and p-value adjustments were used where applicable, and the observed differences were carefully evaluated to minimize the risk of false positives. However, specific confidence intervals for performance metrics were not provided, and the statistical significance of some findings, such as correlation coefficients and metabolomics results, was not explicitly detailed. Overall, the methods used in our study provide a high level of confidence in the reported findings.",
