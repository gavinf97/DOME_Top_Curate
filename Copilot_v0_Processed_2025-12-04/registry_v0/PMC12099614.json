  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from the UK Biobank, a large-scale biomedical database and research resource. The UK Biobank contains genetic, lifestyle, and health information from approximately half a million participants. For this specific study, a carefully selected sample of 1,006 postmenopausal women was utilized. These women had available longitudinal data, as well as information on their age at menarche and age at menopause.\n\nThe UK Biobank holds ethical approval from the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee and has obtained informed consent from all participants. The dataset includes detailed information on various health metrics, lifestyle factors, and genetic data. The sample selection process involved excluding women with pre-existing neurological or psychiatric diagnoses, as well as those with ages at menarche or menopause outside specified ranges to ensure a homogeneous sample.\n\nThe UK Biobank data has been widely used in various research studies, including those focusing on brain health, hormonal changes, and aging. The dataset's robustness and reliability have been demonstrated across different age ranges and scanner types, making it a valuable resource for scientific research. The BrainAGE algorithm, which aggregates complex, spatially distributed age-related changes in brain structure into a single, interpretable biomarker, has been successfully applied in numerous studies, including those capturing hormonal changes in women. This algorithm has also been shown to predict dementia and age-related cognitive decline, highlighting its significance in the field of neuroscience.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was partitioned into 10 equally sized subsets for the purpose of 10-fold cross-validation. In each iteration of this process, one subset was used as the test set, while the remaining nine subsets were used as the training set. This procedure was repeated 10 times, ensuring that each subset served as the test set exactly once. Consequently, each fold contained approximately 1006/10 = 100.6 data points, which can be rounded to 101 data points per fold, considering the need for integer values. The distribution of data points across the folds was balanced, with each fold containing an equal number of data points. This approach helped in assessing the performance metrics, such as mean absolute error, across different subsets of the data, providing a robust evaluation of the models.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of brain scans from 1,006 women, with each woman having an initial brain scan and a follow-up brain scan approximately 2 years apart. To ensure robust and generalizable results, a 10-fold cross-validation approach was employed. This method involved randomly partitioning the dataset into 10 equally sized subsets. In each iteration of the cross-validation, one of these folds was used as the test set, while the remaining nine folds served as the training set. This process was repeated 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set exactly once. This ensured that every data point was used for both training and testing, thereby maximizing the use of the available data and providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nTo estimate individual brain ages, eight models were combined using a general linear model. The weights of these models were derived by maximizing the variance to the parameter of interest, such as menopause. This approach helped in reducing overfitting and ensured that the models were generalizable to new data. The difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age was calculated as the BrainAGE index, which was then used for further statistical analyses.\n\nThe dataset was carefully curated to include only women with available longitudinal data and information on age at menarche and age at menopause. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing neurological or psychiatric diagnoses, as well as women whose age at menarche was outside the range of 10 to 18 years or whose age at menopause was outside the range of 45 to 60 years. This ensured a homogeneous sample, reducing potential confounding variables.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the field of brain aging. The use of a large, well-characterized cohort from the UK Biobank, along with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, ensures that the findings are robust and generalizable. The cross-validation approach further enhances the reliability of the results by ensuring that the training and test sets are independent in each iteration. This independence was enforced through the random partitioning of the dataset into 10 folds, with each fold serving as the test set in a different iteration. This method helps in avoiding data leakage and ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data, providing a true measure of its generalizability.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study are not publicly available in a forum. However, the individual-level proxy measures obtained from the prediction models will be shared after publication, in agreement with UK Biobank regulations. The input data are available to other researchers through the UK Biobank’s controlled access scheme.\n\nTo apply for access, researchers need to register with the UK Biobank and complete an application form detailing a summary of the planned research, the UK Biobank data fields required for the project, and a description of derivatives (data, variables) generated by the project. This procedure ensures that the data is used responsibly and in accordance with ethical guidelines.\n\nThe snapshots of our GitHub repository are available in Software Heritage, and the DOME-ML annotations for this work can be found in the DOME Registry. These resources provide additional transparency and reproducibility for the methods and analyses used in the study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is based on Gaussian process regression. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class, known for its robustness and reliability in handling high-dimensional data. It utilizes a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function. The hyperparameters for this model were set based on prior exploratory analyses, ensuring optimal performance.\n\nThe Gaussian process regression algorithm used is not new; it has been extensively validated and applied in various studies, including those focusing on brain imaging and aging. The decision to use this algorithm was driven by its proven track record in estimating brain age from structural brain images. This method has been successfully applied in numerous research projects, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex, spatially distributed age-related changes in brain structure.\n\nGiven the established nature of Gaussian process regression, there was no need to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this well-validated technique to investigate the relationship between estradiol and brain aging in women. The algorithm's reliability and the extensive body of research supporting its use made it an ideal choice for our study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in our study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates multiple machine-learning algorithms to estimate brain age. Specifically, eight models were developed using different sets of brain images, including variations in gray matter/white matter, Gaussian kernel sizes (4-mm and 8-mm), and image resolutions (4-mm and 8-mm). These individual models were then combined using a general linear model, where the weights of the models were optimized to maximize the variance related to the parameter of interest, such as menopause.\n\nThe constituent machine-learning methods involve Gaussian process regression, which utilizes a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function. Hyperparameters were set based on prior exploratory analyses to ensure robust performance.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training data, a 10-fold cross-validation approach was used. In this method, the dataset was randomly partitioned into 10 equally sized subsets. During each iteration, one fold was used as the test set, while the remaining nine folds served as the training set. This process was repeated 10 times, with performance metrics averaged across all folds. This strategy helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model's generalizability is maintained.\n\nThe use of multiple models and the combination of their outputs through a general linear model allows for a more comprehensive and accurate estimation of brain age, leveraging the strengths of different machine-learning approaches.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the brain images were suitable for analysis. Initially, T1-weighted brain images were acquired using a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra scanner with a 32-channel head coil. These images underwent processing routines implemented in the CAT12 toolbox, resulting in bias-corrected, spatially normalized, and tissue-classified brain images. The normalized gray and white matter partitions were then smoothed using Gaussian kernels with full-width-at-half-maximum values of 4 and 8 mm, and the image resolution was set to 4 and 8 mm.\n\nFor data reduction, a principal component analysis (PCA) using singular value decomposition was applied to all models. Before applying the PCA, the data were normalized by scaling the values between 0 and 1 and subtracting the mean. The transformation matrix derived from the training data PCA was used to project the normalized test data onto the principal component space. This preprocessing ensured that the data were in a suitable format for the Gaussian process regression used to estimate the BrainAGE index. The regression employed a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function, with specific hyperparameters set based on prior exploratory analyses.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model was determined through principal component analysis (PCA). Specifically, we applied PCA using singular value decomposition to all the models, utilizing n –1 PCA components. Here, n represents the minimum of the voxel number or the sample size. This approach allowed us to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most significant variance.\n\nThe selection of the number of parameters was guided by the need to balance model complexity and generalization. By using n –1 PCA components, we ensured that the model captured the essential patterns in the data without overfitting. This method is particularly useful in high-dimensional data, such as brain imaging, where the number of features can be very large compared to the number of samples. The PCA transformation matrix derived from the training data was then used to project the normalized test data onto this principal component space, facilitating the estimation of the BrainAGE index.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized structural brain images as input features for estimating brain age. Specifically, the images underwent several processing steps, including bias correction, spatial normalization, and tissue classification, resulting in gray and white matter partitions. These partitions were then smoothed using Gaussian kernels of 4-mm and 8-mm full-width-at-half-maximum and set to image resolutions of 4 mm and 8 mm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data, using n –1 PCA components, where n is the minimum of the voxel number or sample size. This process ensured that the input features were normalized and scaled between 0 and 1 before applying PCA.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed through the use of PCA, which helps in identifying the most significant components that capture the variance in the data. This dimensionality reduction technique was applied to the training data, and the transformation matrix derived from the PCA was used to project the test data onto the principal component space. This approach ensures that the feature selection process is conducted using the training set only, maintaining the integrity of the test set for unbiased evaluation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a Gaussian process regression, which is well-suited for handling high-dimensional data and avoiding overfitting. The number of parameters in the model is not explicitly large because Gaussian processes use a kernel function to model the relationships in the data, rather than fitting a large number of coefficients.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, a 10-fold cross-validation was implemented. This process involved randomly partitioning the dataset into 10 equally sized subsets. In each iteration, one fold was used as the test set, while the remaining nine folds served as the training set. This procedure was repeated 10 times, ensuring that each fold was used as the test set once. The performance metrics, such as mean absolute error, were averaged across all folds. This cross-validation approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and does not overfit to the training data.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by using a comprehensive set of features derived from the brain images. The data underwent several processing steps, including bias correction, spatial normalization, and tissue classification, which ensured that the input features were informative and relevant. Additionally, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) helped to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most significant variance, thus preventing the model from being too simplistic.\n\nThe hyperparameters for the Gaussian process regression were set based on prior exploratory analyses, which helped to fine-tune the model's performance. Specifically, the constant mean function was set to 100, and the likelihood function was set to -1. These settings were chosen to optimize the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting or underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalizability of our results. One key method was the use of 10-fold cross-validation. This involved randomly partitioning the dataset into 10 equally sized subsets. In each iteration, one fold was used as the test set, while the remaining nine folds served as the training set. This process was repeated 10 times, and performance metrics were averaged across the folds. This approach helped to ensure that our model was not overly tailored to the specific characteristics of any single subset of the data.\n\nAdditionally, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) with singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of our data. This step helped to eliminate noise and redundant information, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. Prior to applying PCA, the data were normalized by scaling the values between 0 and 1 and subtracting the mean, which further aided in stabilizing the model.\n\nFor the estimation of the BrainAGE index, we utilized a Gaussian process regression with specific hyperparameters set based on prior exploratory analyses. This method inherently includes regularization through the choice of the covariance function and the likelihood function, which helps to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.\n\nMoreover, we combined multiple models based on different sets of images (gray matter/white matter, 4-mm/8-mm Gaussian kernel, and 4-mm/8-mm image resolution) using a general linear model. The weights of these models were derived by maximizing the variance to the parameter of interest, such as menopause. This ensemble approach further enhanced the model's robustness and reduced the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated multiple regularization techniques, including cross-validation, PCA, and ensemble modeling, to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensure the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations used in our study are detailed within the methodology section. Specifically, for the Gaussian process regression, hyper-parameters were set to 100 for the constant mean function and to −1 for the likelihood function. These settings were based on prior exploratory analyses.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved a 10-fold cross-validation process, where the dataset was randomly partitioned into 10 equally sized subsets. In each iteration, one fold was used as the test set, and the remaining nine as the training set. This process was repeated 10 times, and performance metrics were averaged across folds.\n\nModel files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the text, but the methods used, including the CAT12 toolbox for image processing and Gaussian process regression for BrainAGE estimation, are well-documented in the literature. The CAT12 toolbox version 12.8 was used, and the Gaussian process regression employed a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function.\n\nRegarding availability and licensing, the study is published under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. This license ensures that the methodological details and findings are accessible to the scientific community for further research and validation.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a combination of several transparent and interpretable techniques to estimate brain age. The process begins with the use of T1-weighted brain images, which are processed using the CAT12 toolbox to produce bias-corrected, spatially normalized, and tissue-classified brain images. These images are then smoothed using Gaussian kernels and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. The PCA transformation matrix derived from the training data is used to project the normalized test data onto the principal component space, ensuring that the data reduction process is transparent and reproducible.\n\nFor the estimation of the BrainAGE index, a Gaussian process regression is employed. This regression model uses a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function. The hyperparameters for these functions are set based on prior exploratory analyses, providing a clear and justifiable basis for the model's configuration. The BrainAGE index is calculated as the difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age, offering an interpretable biomarker that indicates whether a brain is estimated to be younger or older than its actual age.\n\nAdditionally, the study uses a general linear model to combine eight different models based on various sets of images. The weights of these models are derived by maximizing the variance to the parameter of interest, such as menopause, ensuring that the contribution of each model to the final BrainAGE index is transparent and can be traced back to specific biological factors.\n\nThe statistical analyses conducted, including cross-sectional and longitudinal streams, further enhance the interpretability of the model. The results reveal significant associations between the BrainAGE index and reproductive factors, such as the age at menarche and menopause, providing clear insights into how these biological factors influence brain aging. The effect sizes and slopes of the regression analyses are also reported, allowing for a detailed understanding of the relationships observed.\n\nOverall, the model's transparency is ensured through the use of well-defined processing routines, interpretable statistical methods, and clear reporting of results. This approach allows researchers and clinicians to understand the underlying mechanisms and factors contributing to brain aging, making the model a valuable tool for studying the influence of biological factors across the female lifespan.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a regression model, specifically a Gaussian process regression. This model is used to estimate brain age based on structural brain images. The difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age yields the BrainAGE index, which is a continuous value indicating whether a brain is estimated to be younger or older than its chronological age. The model uses a linear covariance function, a constant mean function, and a Gaussian likelihood function. It was trained on a dataset of 3,046 individuals from the UK Biobank, with 10-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting. The BrainAGE index is then used in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to investigate associations with reproductive factors such as the age at menarche, age at menopause, and reproductive span.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model was not explicitly detailed. However, the process involved several steps, including data preprocessing, principal component analysis, and Gaussian process regression. These steps were applied to a dataset of 1,006 women, with each woman having two brain scans. The dataset was partitioned into 10 subsets for cross-validation, and the process was repeated 10 times. Additionally, the model combined eight different sets of images using a general linear model, which further contributed to the computational load. Given the complexity and scale of the data, it is reasonable to infer that the model required a significant amount of time to run, likely spanning several hours or even days, depending on the computational resources available.",

This openness promotes transparency and reproducibility in scientific research.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in our study involved a rigorous cross-validation approach to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings. Specifically, we utilized 10-fold cross-validation for both the initial and follow-up brain scans. This process involved randomly partitioning the dataset into 10 equally sized subsets. In each iteration, one fold was used as the test set, while the remaining nine folds served as the training set. This procedure was repeated 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set once. Performance metrics, such as mean absolute error, were averaged across all folds to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nTo estimate individual brain ages, we combined eight models based on different sets of images, including gray matter/white matter, 4-mm/8-mm Gaussian kernel, and 4-mm/8-mm image resolution. These models were integrated using a general linear model, where the weights were derived by maximizing the variance to the parameter of interest, such as menopause. The difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age was then calculated to obtain the BrainAGE index in years.\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted using linear regressions in MATLAB, with an alpha set at 0.05 (two-tailed). For the cross-sectional stream, we tested the significance of the link between the BrainAGE index at the initial brain scan and various reproductive factors, including reproductive span, age at menarche, and age at menopause. For the longitudinal stream, we calculated the change in the BrainAGE index between the initial and follow-up scans, referred to as the ΔBrainAGE index. This change score was then analyzed for significant links with the same reproductive factors.\n\nSensitivity analyses were also performed to account for potential confounds known to affect brain health. These included factors such as the number of live births, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes, education, income, and a composite lifestyle factor. Missing data for these confounds were imputed using the MATLAB function \"fillmissing,\" which replaced missing entries with values from the nearest neighbor rows based on pairwise Euclidean distance. This imputation method was applied to up to 295 women, depending on the specific confound being considered.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we primarily focused on the BrainAGE index as our key performance metric. This index represents the difference between the estimated brain age, derived from structural brain images using a high-dimensional pattern recognition approach, and the chronological age of the individual. To ensure the robustness of our BrainAGE estimates, we employed a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. This involved randomly partitioning the dataset into 10 equally sized subsets, using one fold as the test set and the remaining nine as the training set in each iteration. This process was repeated 10 times, and the performance metrics, specifically the mean absolute error, were averaged across all folds.\n\nThe mean absolute error is a well-established metric in the literature for evaluating the accuracy of brain age prediction models. It provides a straightforward measure of the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, without considering their direction. This metric is widely used and accepted in the field, making it a representative choice for our study.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to account for potential confounds known to affect brain health. These analyses included adjusting for factors such as the number of live births, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes, education, income, and a composite lifestyle factor. These adjustments help to ensure that our findings are robust and not merely artifacts of these confounding variables.\n\nIn summary, our use of the BrainAGE index and mean absolute error as performance metrics aligns with established practices in the literature. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of our brain age prediction model's accuracy and robustness.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on estimating brain age using structural brain images and a high-dimensional pattern recognition approach. It did not involve a comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The research primarily centered on analyzing the relationship between the BrainAGE index and reproductive factors such as the age at menarche, age at menopause, and reproductive span. The methods used included cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, with sensitivity analyses accounting for various potential confounds. The study employed a Gaussian process regression for brain age estimation and used a 10-fold cross-validation approach to ensure the robustness of the results.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study involved rigorous statistical analyses to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. We employed linear regressions in MATLAB to assess the relationships between the BrainAGE index and various reproductive factors. For all analyses, we set the alpha level at 0.05 (two-tailed), which is a standard threshold for determining statistical significance.\n\nIn our cross-sectional analyses, we found significant links between the BrainAGE index and reproductive span, age at menarche, and age at menopause. These results were supported by small but significant effect sizes, with r-values indicating the strength and direction of these associations. For instance, the r-values were −0.11 for reproductive span, 0.14 for age at menarche, and −0.09 for age at menopause. The slopes of the regression lines further quantified these relationships, showing that brains of women with longer reproductive spans were estimated to be younger.\n\nOur longitudinal findings confirmed these cross-sectional relationships. The ΔBrainAGE index, which measures the change in BrainAGE over time, was significantly linked to reproductive span, age at menarche, and age at menopause. Again, the effect sizes were small but significant, with r-values of −0.12 for reproductive span, 0.06 for age at menarche, and −0.12 for age at menopause. These results suggest that the BrainAGE index is a reliable biomarker for assessing brain aging in relation to reproductive factors.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses that accounted for potential confounds known to affect brain health. These included factors such as the number of live births, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes, education, income, and a composite lifestyle factor. We used an imputation method to handle missing data, replacing missing entries with values from the nearest neighbor rows based on pairwise Euclidean distance. This approach helped to maintain the integrity of our dataset and the validity of our statistical analyses.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics and statistical analyses provide strong evidence for the reliability and significance of our findings. The BrainAGE index demonstrates consistent and significant associations with reproductive factors, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, supporting its use as a biomarker for brain aging.",
