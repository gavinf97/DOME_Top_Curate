  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in our study encompasses multiple classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their associated disease data. For miRNAs, the associations with diseases were sourced from the HMDD v4.0 database, while the sequence information was obtained from the miRBase database. In the case of lncRNAs and circRNAs, the associations with diseases were gathered from the LncRNADisease v3.0 database. The sequence information for circRNAs was retrieved from the circBase database, and for lncRNAs, it was collected from both the GENCODE and NONCODE databases. For piRNAs, the associations with diseases were obtained from the piRDisease v1.0 database, with sequence information sourced from the piRBase and piRNAdb databases. Disease information was acquired using Disease Ontology Identifiers (DOIDs) from the Disease Ontology database. The construction of the ncRNA–disease association network involved merging data entries from these association databases. This comprehensive dataset allows for a robust analysis of the associations between various types of ncRNAs and diseases, leveraging both sequence information and known disease associations.",

  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in our study encompasses multiple classes of noncoding RNAs and their associated disease information. The specific databases employed include HMDD v4.0 for miRNA-disease associations, miRBase for miRNA sequences, LncRNADisease v3.0 for lncRNA and circRNA associations, circBase for circRNA sequences, GENCODE and NONCODE for lncRNA sequences, piRDisease v1.0 for piRNA-disease associations, and piRBase and piRNAdb for piRNA sequences. Disease information was obtained from the Disease Ontology database.\n\nThe data splits used in our experiments were generated through a 5-fold cross-validation process to ensure robust and unbiased performance evaluation. This process involved dividing the dataset into five subsets, where each subset was used once as the validation set while the remaining four subsets were used for training. This methodology helps in assessing the model's performance across different data partitions and ensures that the results are generalizable.\n\nRegarding the release of the data, the datasets used in this study are publicly available through their respective databases. The specific licenses and access conditions for these databases can be found on their respective websites. For instance, HMDD v4.0, miRBase, LncRNADisease v3.0, circBase, GENCODE, NONCODE, piRDisease v1.0, piRBase, piRNAdb, and the Disease Ontology database all have their own terms of use and licensing agreements that govern how the data can be accessed and utilized.\n\nTo enforce the proper use of the data, we adhered to the licensing agreements and terms of use specified by each database. This includes proper citation of the data sources in our publication and ensuring that the data is used solely for the purposes outlined in our study. Additionally, we have made efforts to ensure that the data splits generated through our 5-fold cross-validation process are reproducible, allowing other researchers to validate our findings and build upon our work.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our framework leverages a combination of well-established machine-learning techniques tailored for the specific task of ncRNA-disease association prediction. The core of our approach involves the use of transformer encoders, which are a type of neural network architecture known for their effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies in sequential data. These encoders are integral to our model's ability to process and represent ncRNA sequences.\n\nThe transformer encoders utilize multihead self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different sequence elements dynamically. This is particularly crucial for ncRNA sequences, where functional elements like binding sites or seed regions can interact over long distances. By stacking multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks, the model generates rich contextual representations of the sequences.\n\nIn addition to the transformer encoders, our framework incorporates a masked language model (MLM) pretraining strategy. This involves randomly masking certain tokens in the ncRNA sequences and training the model to predict the original tokens based on their context. This process helps the model learn contextual dependencies and identify potential functional motifs within the sequences.\n\nThe embedding representation in our model is multifaceted, comprising token embeddings, positional embeddings, and segment embeddings. Token embeddings capture the semantic features of each 6-mer, positional embeddings encode the order of nucleotides, and segment embeddings differentiate between distinct segments in concatenated sequences. This multilevel embedding strategy ensures that the model retains both local nucleotide features and the global topological structure of the sequences.\n\nThe association prediction task is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the association score between each ncRNA and disease is calculated through the dot product of their representations, followed by normalization using the sigmoid function. This approach allows the model to predict the likelihood of an association between an ncRNA and a disease.\n\nWhile the individual components of our optimization algorithm are not entirely novel, their integration and application to the specific problem of ncRNA-disease association prediction represent a significant advancement. The choice to publish in a bioinformatics journal rather than a machine-learning journal is driven by the biological relevance and impact of our work. Our focus is on demonstrating the practical utility of these techniques in the context of biological data, rather than on the theoretical contributions to machine learning. This aligns with our goal of advancing the field of bioinformatics and providing tools that can be directly applied to biological research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The PanGIA framework does not operate as a traditional meta-predictor that aggregates predictions from multiple independent machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it is a comprehensive model designed to predict associations between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and diseases using a multitask learning approach.\n\nPanGIA integrates various components to enhance its predictive power. These components include a Heterogeneous Attention Network (HAN), a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism, and a cross-task attention module. The HAN captures structural information from the heterogeneous graph, while the MoE mechanism allows the model to leverage task-specific experts. The cross-task attention module facilitates the integration of information across different tasks, improving the overall predictive accuracy.\n\nThe training data for PanGIA is derived from a full-spectrum heterogeneous association network, which includes various types of ncRNAs (miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and piRNA) and their associations with diseases. The model is trained using a combination of these data types, ensuring that the information is interdependent rather than independent. This interdependence is crucial for the model's ability to capture complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy.\n\nIn summary, PanGIA is not a meta-predictor in the traditional sense but rather a sophisticated framework that combines multiple advanced techniques to achieve robust and accurate predictions of ncRNA-disease associations. The training data is interdependent, reflecting the complex nature of biological systems.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to prepare the ncRNA sequences and disease association data for the machine-learning algorithm. We began by tokenizing ncRNA sequences into fixed-length k-mers of size 6. To ensure compatibility with DNA-based models like DNABERT, all uracil (U) bases in the RNA sequences were replaced with thymine (T). This tokenization process conceptualizes DNA/RNA sequences as a specialized form of language, where each nucleotide fragment of length 6 serves as an independent lexical unit. This approach has been shown to effectively preserve local sequence features while capturing long-range dependencies, providing a solid foundation for subsequent deep representation learning.\n\nFollowing tokenization, we employed a masked language model (MLM) pretraining strategy. In this strategy, a subset of tokens was randomly masked, and the model was trained to recover the original tokens based on their surrounding context. This mechanism helps identify potential functional motifs and enhances the ability to capture their regulatory roles under diverse contextual environments.\n\nAt the input layer, each 6-mer token was mapped into a dense vector representation composed of three components: token embedding, positional embedding, and segment embedding. Token embedding captures the semantic features of the current 6-mer, positional embedding encodes the positional information of each token within the sequence, and segment embedding differentiates between distinct segments in concatenated sequences. This multilevel embedding strategy allows the model to retain local nucleotide features while capturing the global topological structure of the sequence, providing a comprehensive representation for downstream tasks.\n\nFor the disease data, we utilized Disease Ontology Identifiers (DOIDs) to construct the disease similarity matrix, with corresponding information obtained from the Disease Ontology database. This matrix, along with the ncRNA sequence data, was used to construct a heterogeneous graph. The graph includes nodes for ncRNAs and diseases, with edges representing known associations and similarities between them. This structured foundation integrates multiclass ncRNA similarities into downstream graph-based learning, enabling robust association prediction.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, the number of parameters, denoted as p, is determined by several key components. The primary contributors to p include the token embeddings, positional embeddings, and segment embeddings used in the input layer. Each 6-mer token is mapped into a dense vector, and the dimensionality of these vectors significantly influences the total parameter count.\n\nThe transformer encoders, which process the sequence representations, also contribute substantially to p. These encoders consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks. The depth of the transformer stack and the dimensionality of the hidden states within these layers are critical factors in determining p.\n\nThe selection of p was guided by a balance between model capacity and computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments to identify the optimal configuration that maximizes predictive performance while remaining feasible to train. This involved tuning hyperparameters such as the number of transformer layers, the hidden state dimensions, and the number of attention heads. Through this systematic approach, we ensured that the model's architecture is both powerful and practical for the tasks at hand.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our model consist of embeddings derived from ncRNA sequences and disease representations. For ncRNAs, the sequences are first tokenized into fixed-length 6-mers, where all uracil (U) bases are replaced with thymine (T) to ensure compatibility with DNA-based models. These tokenized sequences are then embedded using a combination of token, positional, and segment embeddings. This multilevel embedding strategy captures both local nucleotide features and the global topological structure of the sequences.\n\nFor diseases, the embeddings are initially mapped into the same space as the ncRNA embeddings using a learnable linear transformation matrix. This ensures that both types of entities are represented in a comparable feature space.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, the model leverages a heterogeneous graph that integrates ncRNA similarity, disease similarity, and known ncRNA-disease associations. This graph structure inherently selects relevant features by focusing on the relationships and similarities between entities.\n\nThe embedding dimensions for ncRNAs and diseases are denoted as dr and dd, respectively. These dimensions are crucial for the subsequent steps in the model, where the embeddings are processed through a heterogeneous attention network (HAN) to extract higher-order semantic features. The intermediate hidden dimension, dh, is used to represent the output of the HAN encoder, which provides the hidden representations of ncRNAs and diseases.\n\nIn summary, the input features are the embeddings of ncRNA sequences and disease representations, which are processed and transformed within the model to capture relevant information for association prediction. The dimensions of these embeddings are dr for ncRNAs and dd for diseases, with an intermediate hidden dimension dh used in the HAN encoder.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The PanGIA framework employs a robust fitting method designed to handle the complexity of multitype ncRNA-disease association prediction. The model's architecture includes several key components, such as the Heterogeneous Attention Network (HAN), Mixture of Experts (MoE), and a cross-task attention mechanism, each contributing uniquely to its predictive power.\n\nThe number of parameters in PanGIA is indeed substantial, reflecting the model's capacity to capture intricate relationships within the data. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, especially given the high dimensionality of the parameter space relative to the number of training points, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the use of dropout layers during training helps to regularize the model by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which prevents units from co-adapting too much. Secondly, the model's performance was systematically evaluated using cross-validation, specifically 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, ablation studies were conducted by progressively removing core modules and comparing the performance metrics, which provided insights into the necessity and contribution of each component, thereby validating the model's design choices.\n\nTo address underfitting, the model leverages a multitask learning approach, which allows it to learn shared representations across different types of ncRNAs and diseases. This design enhances the model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. Furthermore, the use of a masked language model (MLM) pretraining strategy ensures that the model learns contextual dependencies within the sequence, providing a solid foundation for subsequent deep representation learning. The transformer encoding layers, with their multihead self-attention mechanism, enable the model to capture long-range dependencies and interactions within the sequences, further enriching the learned representations.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method of PanGIA is carefully designed to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. Through the use of regularization techniques, cross-validation, and a comprehensive model architecture, PanGIA achieves robust and generalizable performance in predicting ncRNA-disease associations.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a random uniform subsampling strategy to prevent overfitting and to evaluate the robustness of our model under constrained information settings. This strategy involved randomly and uniformly removing a certain proportion of ncRNA and disease nodes from the heterogeneous graph, along with their associated edges. This approach ensured that both types of nodes were reduced at the same rate, preserving the relative balance between modalities in the network while decreasing the overall graph size. By gradually scaling down the input network, we simulated scenarios with limited data availability. This allowed us to examine how our model, PanGIA, performs under data-sparse conditions and to assess its sensitivity to the quantity of training data. The results indicated that PanGIA's predictive capability is notably affected under data-sparse conditions, underscoring the critical importance of data completeness in achieving optimal predictive performance.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The PanGIA model is designed to be interpretable, providing insights into its decision-making process. Unlike black-box models, PanGIA leverages a structured approach that allows for a clear understanding of how associations between ncRNAs and diseases are predicted.\n\nOne key aspect of PanGIA's interpretability is its use of embeddings and attention mechanisms. The model employs a multilevel embedding strategy that includes token, positional, and segment embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic features, positional information, and segment differentiation, respectively. This approach ensures that the model retains both local nucleotide features and the global topological structure of the sequence, making it easier to trace back how specific sequence elements contribute to the final predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the model uses a masked language model (MLM) pretraining strategy, which helps in identifying potential functional motifs within the ncRNA sequences. By masking certain tokens and training the model to reconstruct them based on the surrounding context, PanGIA learns contextual dependencies within the sequence. This mechanism not only enhances the model's ability to capture regulatory roles under diverse contextual environments but also provides a clear pathway for understanding which parts of the sequence are crucial for prediction.\n\nThe cross-task attention mechanism further enhances interpretability by allowing the model to integrate information across different tasks. This mechanism ensures that the model can weigh the importance of various features and tasks, providing a transparent view of how different types of ncRNAs and diseases interact.\n\nMoreover, the ablation studies conducted on PanGIA highlight the contributions of different components, such as the Heterogeneous Attention Network (HAN) and the Mixture of Experts (MoE). By systematically removing these components and observing the performance decline, it becomes evident how each part of the model contributes to the overall predictive power. This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the model's internal workings and the importance of each component.\n\nIn summary, PanGIA is not a black-box model. Its design, which includes embeddings, attention mechanisms, and comprehensive ablation studies, ensures that the model's decision-making process is transparent and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for understanding the associations between ncRNAs and diseases and for validating the model's predictions with biological evidence.",
  "model/output": "The model is designed for a binary classification problem, specifically for predicting associations between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and diseases. The output of the model is a probability score indicating the likelihood that a particular ncRNA is associated with a specific disease. This score is derived from the dot product of task-specific RNA representations and disease node representations, followed by a sigmoid function to normalize the output between 0 and 1. The model does not serve as the final classifier but rather as a task-dependent feature extractor, with the prediction itself achieved through the interaction between RNA and disease embeddings. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as AUC, AUPR, and Rank Index, which are standard for classification tasks.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the PanGIA model was conducted using a comprehensive approach to ensure its robustness and generalizability. We employed 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance, which involved dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once.\n\nTo evaluate the model's performance, we used three key metrics: AUC (Area Under the Curve), AUPR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve), and Rank Index. These metrics provided a thorough assessment of the model's ability to predict associations between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and diseases.\n\nIn addition to cross-validation, we conducted systematic performance evaluations under different data availability scenarios. This included gradually reducing the input network size using a random uniform subsampling strategy, where a certain proportion of ncRNA and disease nodes were randomly and uniformly removed from the heterogeneous graph. This approach simulated scenarios with limited data availability and allowed us to examine how PanGIA performs under constrained information settings.\n\nFurthermore, we performed a stepwise ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different ncRNA types to the model's predictive performance. This involved progressively removing specific categories of ncRNAs from the full pan-ncRNA set and assessing the model's performance using the same evaluation metrics.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of key components in the PanGIA framework, we conducted a series of ablation experiments by systematically removing core modules, including the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and the cross-task attention mechanism. Additionally, a single-task learning variant was tested to contrast against the full multitask framework.\n\nThe results of these evaluations demonstrated that PanGIA consistently achieved superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics and RNA types, highlighting its exceptional generalization ability and predictive accuracy in multitype ncRNA–disease association prediction.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the PanGIA model, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to ensure a thorough assessment of its predictive capabilities. The primary metrics used were the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR), and the Rank Index.\n\nThe AUC is a widely recognized metric in the field of machine learning and bioinformatics, providing a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of a binary classifier across all classification thresholds. It is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, which are common in biological data. The AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect classification and a value of 0.5 indicates performance no better than random guessing.\n\nThe AUPR is another crucial metric, especially for tasks where the positive class is rare. It focuses on the precision-recall trade-off, making it more informative than AUC in scenarios with highly imbalanced data. The AUPR also ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n\nThe Rank Index is a metric specifically designed for ranking tasks, which is relevant in the context of predicting associations between ncRNAs and diseases. It measures the average rank of true positive instances, with lower values indicating better performance. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the model's ability to prioritize true associations over false ones.\n\nThese metrics are representative of the standards used in the literature for evaluating association prediction models in bioinformatics. They provide a balanced view of the model's performance, covering both classification accuracy and ranking quality. The use of these metrics allows for a fair comparison of PanGIA with other existing methods, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying ncRNA-disease associations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our PanGIA framework, we conducted a comprehensive comparison with various publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. This comparison was essential to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of PanGIA in predicting ncRNA-disease associations.\n\nWe evaluated PanGIA against several state-of-the-art models, including NIMGSA, MINIMDA, gGATLDA, LDGRNMF, iPiDi-PUL, PUTransGCN, IGNSCDA, and GATCL2CD. These models represent a range of approaches tailored to different types of ncRNAs, such as miRNA, lncRNA, piRNA, and circRNA. The evaluation metrics used were AUC, AUPR, and Rank Index, which provide a thorough assessment of the models' predictive performance.\n\nThe results, summarized in Table 1, show that PanGIA consistently outperformed the baseline methods across all ncRNA types. For instance, PanGIA achieved the highest AUC and AUPR for miRNA, lncRNA, piRNA, and circRNA, indicating its superior ability to accurately predict associations. Furthermore, when all ncRNA types were integrated, PanGIA's performance was further enhanced, achieving the highest AUC and AUPR and the lowest Rank Index. This demonstrates PanGIA's exceptional generalization ability and predictive accuracy in multitype ncRNA-disease association prediction.\n\nIn addition to comparing with publicly available methods, we also evaluated PanGIA against simpler baselines. These baselines included variants of PanGIA with key components removed, such as the Heterogeneous Attention Network (HAN), Mixture of Experts (MoE), and the cross-task attention mechanism. We also tested a single-task learning variant to contrast against the full multitask framework. The results, illustrated in Figures 4, 5, and 6, showed that removing any of these core components led to a noticeable performance decline across all metrics. This underscores the importance of each module in PanGIA's architecture and confirms that the full model's design is crucial for its predictive power.\n\nOverall, the comparison with both publicly available methods and simpler baselines highlights PanGIA's advanced capabilities and robustness in ncRNA-disease association prediction.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of PanGIA's performance includes confidence intervals for the metrics used, such as AUC, AUPR, and Rank Index. These intervals provide a measure of the variability and reliability of the results. For instance, in the performance comparison table, the AUC values for different models and RNA categories are presented with their respective standard deviations, indicating the confidence in these estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is also considered in the evaluation. The consistent performance of PanGIA across various RNA types and its superior results compared to baseline methods suggest that the differences are not due to random chance. The use of 5-fold cross-validation further strengthens the reliability of the findings, as it ensures that the model's performance is assessed across different subsets of the data.\n\nMoreover, the ablation studies and subsampling experiments provide additional evidence of PanGIA's robustness and the statistical significance of its components. The progressive removal of core modules and the reduction of data scale both resulted in noticeable declines in performance metrics, highlighting the importance of each component and the overall model design. These systematic evaluations collectively support the claim that PanGIA is superior to other methods and baselines in ncRNA-disease association prediction.",
