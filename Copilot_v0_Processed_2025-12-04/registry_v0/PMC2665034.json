  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used for validation in our study is a publicly available tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007). This dataset, known as the 60cm dataset, can be accessed at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/retention/data/data.html. It comprises a collection of 18,149 spectra derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate. This dataset has been previously described and used in the community to demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across different peptide sets. The yeast protein sequence database used to search the test dataset was first digested to tryptic peptides in silico, by cleaving protein sequences after lysine (K) or arginine (R) except when followed by proline (P), and allowing internal missed cleavages.

The resulting peptides were then indexed by their mass in Daltons (Da), rounded to the nearest integer. For each test spectrum, a list of candidate peptides was created by rounding the spectrum’s mass in Da (assuming a charge of +2) to the nearest integer and extracting all peptides within ±3 Da of the rounded mass. To further refine this list, a filtering step akin to the Sequest Sp score was applied. This process ensures that the dataset is manageable and relevant for the model's training and validation purposes.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in our study were carefully selected and processed to ensure independence between training and test sets. For training, we utilized a dataset consisting of 1208 charge +2 peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) derived from E.coli protein sequence database. These PSMs were generated using multiple algorithms to mitigate bias and were filtered to ensure high confidence. The spectra were obtained from a yeast whole-cell lysate and were processed to include only those with a single isotope distribution, ensuring homogeneity.\n\nFor validation, we employed a publicly available tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007), known as the 60cm dataset. This dataset comprises 18149 spectra and was used to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize across different peptide sets. The yeast protein sequence database used for the test dataset was digested in silico to tryptic peptides, and the resulting peptides were indexed by their mass in Daltons (Da) rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nTo enforce independence between the training and test sets, we ensured that the training data consisted of high-confidence PSMs from E.coli, while the test data came from a completely different source, yeast. This approach helps to validate the model's performance on unseen data and ensures that the results are not biased by overfitting to the training dataset.\n\nThe distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in proteomics. By using a diverse set of algorithms and ensuring high-confidence PSMs, we aimed to create a robust training set. The test set, derived from a different organism, provides a stringent evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities. This methodology aligns with best practices in machine learning for ensuring that models are both accurate and generalizable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used for validation in our study is publicly available. Specifically, we utilized a tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007), which can be accessed as the 60cm dataset at the URL http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/retention/data/data.html.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our work is dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). These networks are employed to model the probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities. The DBNs used in our approach are not entirely new, as they are a well-established class of probabilistic graphical models. However, their application to the specific problem of peptide fragmentation in mass spectrometry is novel and tailored to our needs.\n\nThe reason this work was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our research is on the biological and biochemical insights gained from the analysis of peptide fragmentation data. The machine-learning aspects are a means to an end, enabling us to achieve our biological goals more effectively. The DBNs are used to learn and interpret the underlying patterns in the data, which in turn provides valuable information about peptide fragmentation biochemistry. This biological context and the practical applications of our findings are more aligned with the scope of journals in the fields of bioinformatics, proteomics, and computational biology.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication can indeed be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates outputs from multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance peptide identification.\n\nThe core of the model consists of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that learn probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities. These DBNs are trained on high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and generate feature vectors for each PSM, which are then used as input to additional analysis software.\n\nOne of the machine-learning methods used in conjunction with the DBNs is the support vector machine (SVM). The feature vectors generated by the DBNs can be input into an SVM, which then assigns scores to the PSMs. This combination improves peptide identification at a 1% false discovery rate by a significant margin.\n\nAnother machine-learning method integrated into the model is the semi-supervised learning algorithm Percolator. Percolator uses an SVM to iteratively learn to discriminate between correct and incorrect PSMs by using PSMs from a decoy dataset as a proxy for incorrect PSMs in the target dataset. When Riptide’s feature vectors are combined with those used in the original Percolator publication, there is a notable improvement in the identification of correct PSMs.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, the model starts with a collection of high-confidence PSMs generated through a specific process. Each of these spectra is associated with a randomly generated peptide to create a set of negative PSMs. These positive and negative PSMs are used to train separate DBNs, ensuring that the training data for the positive and negative models is independent. This independence is crucial for the model's ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect PSMs effectively.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the spectra were suitable for training and testing the model.\n\nWe began with a collection of high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) generated from a dataset of MS/MS spectra. These PSMs were used to train the Riptide model, which consists of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that model the probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities.\n\nThe spectra were first processed to ensure they came from homogeneous populations of peptides. This was achieved using the isotope detection algorithm HardKlör, which selected MS/MS spectra with an associated MS spectrum containing only one isotope distribution within a specific window of the precursor ion.\n\nThe resulting peptides were then analyzed using multiple algorithms to mitigate bias from any single algorithm. These algorithms included Sequest, OMMSA, ProbID, PepNovo, Luteﬁsk, Inspect, and GutenTag. Parameters for each algorithm were set to search all peptides with a precursor mass tolerance of +/−2.5 Da. PSMs from each algorithm were accepted if they met criteria such as a minimum length of six amino acids, a charge of +2, and being fully tryptic with no missed cleavages.\n\nTo ensure the quality of the PSMs, we estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) by searching the spectra against a randomly shuffled sequence database. PSMs were sorted by their primary scoring metric, and thresholds were set consistent with an FDR of 1%.\n\nFor the testing dataset, we used a publicly available tandem MS dataset consisting of 18,149 spectra derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate. The yeast protein sequence database was digested in silico to tryptic peptides, and the resulting peptides were indexed by their mass in Daltons (Da) rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nFor each test spectrum, a list of candidate peptides was created by rounding the spectrum’s mass to the nearest integer and extracting all peptides within a specific mass range. To manage the large number of candidate peptides, a filtering step akin to the Sequest Sp score was applied.\n\nThe resulting feature vectors, comprised of probabilities assigned by the Riptide DBNs, were used as input to additional algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) or the semi-supervised learning algorithm Percolator. These feature vectors improved peptide identification at a 1% false discovery rate by significant margins when used with either SVM or Percolator.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, the number of parameters used is determined by the structure of our dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Specifically, at the center of each frame of the single-ion model, we have a random variable representing ion intensity, which is modeled using a mixture of three Gaussians. This results in eight free parameters for each single-ion model: three means, three variances, and two weights.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by the natural ion intensity distributions observed in our data. Most distributions exhibit a single large peak that tapers into a broad background distribution, which is well-matched by the use of three Gaussians. This choice allows our model to effectively capture the variability in ion intensities across different spectra.\n\nAdditionally, the model incorporates several other variables that influence the probability of peak detection and intensity. These include variables indicating whether a peak is within the detectable range of the mass spectrometer and whether it is actually detected, as well as variables representing the flanking amino acids and the position of the peak along the m/z axis. These variables help to refine the model's predictions by accounting for factors that affect ion detectability and intensity.\n\nThe overall structure of the DBNs, including the number of parameters, was designed to balance model complexity and generalization ability. By using a mixture of Gaussians and incorporating relevant biological and instrumental variables, we aim to create a robust model that can accurately predict peptide fragment ion intensities and improve peptide identification in mass spectrometry data.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a combination of features derived from different sources to optimize peptide identification. Initially, we tested the original 20 features used in the Percolator algorithm, which include metrics like Xcorr, Sp, and deltCN from the Sequest algorithm, along with features describing the tryptic termini of peptides.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated 99 features generated by the Riptide model, which are based on the probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities. These features are derived from dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that model the intensities of various ion types and their dependencies on flanking amino acids and other factors.\n\nWe also explored the use of all 119 features combined, which includes both the original Percolator features and the Riptide-derived features. This combined set of features resulted in a 12.4% improvement in positive identifications at a 1% false discovery rate.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by choosing different subsets of features for comparison. The original Percolator features were selected based on prior knowledge and their known effectiveness in discriminating between correct and incorrect peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). The Riptide features were selected based on the model's ability to capture the underlying probability distributions of ion intensities.\n\nThe selection and evaluation of these feature sets were conducted using a validation dataset, ensuring that the feature selection process did not bias the results. The use of 5-fold nested cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning further ensured that the model's performance was generalized and not overfitted to the training data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involves dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to model the probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities. The DBNs are trained using high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), which are used to create both positive and negative training sets. This approach helps in managing the complexity of the model by controlling the number of trainable parameters, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we utilized a parameter-reduction machinery within the DBN framework. This machinery allows the model to generalize well across different peptide sets, even when trained on a relatively small number of spectra. Additionally, we employed 5-fold nested cross-validation to select the hyperparameters for the support vector machine (SVM), ensuring that the model's performance is robust and not merely a result of overfitting to the training data.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by the use of a comprehensive feature set derived from the DBNs. These features capture the intricate details of peptide fragmentation patterns, providing a rich representation of the data. Furthermore, the model's ability to learn from both positive and negative PSMs ensures that it can discriminate effectively between correct and incorrect identifications, thus avoiding underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involves a balance between complexity and generalization, achieved through the use of DBNs and careful selection of hyperparameters via cross-validation. This approach ensures that the model neither overfits nor underfits the data, leading to reliable and accurate peptide identifications.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalization of our model. One key method involved the use of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) within the Riptide model. These DBNs are designed to control model complexity by switching parents, which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. This reduction helps in mitigating overfitting, especially when training on a limited dataset.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a Gaussian kernel in our support vector machine (SVM) and selected hyperparameters through 5-fold nested cross-validation. This process involved optimizing the parameters C and σ, where C is the soft-margin penalty for misclassified examples and σ is the width of the Gaussian. By selecting the parameters that maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we ensured that our model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we simulated a discriminative training procedure by explicitly training positive and negative models separately. This approach was motivated by the desire to obtain interpretable probabilistic parameters, which a model trained solely on positive peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) allows. This method helps in maintaining the model's ability to generalize across different datasets and conditions.\n\nIn summary, our regularization methods included parameter reduction through DBNs, hyperparameter optimization via cross-validation, and separate training of positive and negative models. These techniques collectively contribute to the robustness and generalization capability of our model.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, for the Support Vector Machine (SVM), we utilized a Gaussian kernel with hyperparameters C and σ. The selection of these hyperparameters was performed using 5-fold nested cross-validation, where the parameter yielding the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was chosen. This process ensures that the model's performance is robust and generalizable.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, these details are not explicitly mentioned as being publicly accessible. However, the methodology and the specific configurations used for training and validation are thoroughly described, allowing for reproducibility by other researchers.\n\nThe dataset used for validation is publicly available. It is a tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007), known as the 60cm dataset, which can be accessed at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/retention/data/data.html. This dataset consists of 18149 spectra derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate, providing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the model's performance.\n\nFor those interested in implementing or replicating our work, the described procedures and parameters offer a clear pathway. The use of standard machine learning techniques and publicly available datasets facilitates the reproducibility of our results. However, specific model files and optimization parameters are not provided in a downloadable format.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this work, known as Riptide, is designed to be highly interpretable, which sets it apart from many other machine learning approaches. Unlike black-box models, Riptide's governing parameters are automatically learned and are highly interpretable, providing scientific insight into the phenomena it models.\n\nRiptide consists of a collection of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that capture physical properties of peptide fragmentation. These DBNs model the probability distributions governing peptide fragment ion intensities, and their parameters can be directly interpreted in the context of peptide chemistry.\n\nFor instance, the single-ion models within Riptide learn probability relationships such as \"b-ions N-term to proline tend to have high intensity\" or \"y-ions C-term to aspartate have low intensity.\" These relationships are intuitive and directly related to the chemical properties of the amino acids involved. Similarly, the paired-ion models capture relationships between pairs of ions, such as \"b- and y-ions that result from the same cleavage location tend to have intensities of similar height.\" These models provide a clear and interpretable way to understand how different ions interact during fragmentation.\n\nThe interpretability of Riptide is further enhanced by its ability to detect trends in peptide fragment intensity. For example, the model has identified a tendency towards higher intensity a-ion peaks and a-ion neutral loss peaks from cleavage sites C-term to hydrophobic residues. This kind of insight is valuable not only for understanding the underlying chemistry but also for improving peptide identification.\n\nIn summary, Riptide is not a black-box model. Its design and the relationships it learns are transparent and directly interpretable, making it a powerful tool for both scientific discovery and practical applications in peptide identification.",
  "model/output": "The model is primarily designed for classification rather than regression. It focuses on evaluating peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) by assigning probabilities to indicate whether a given PSM is positive (correct) or negative (incorrect). The output of the model consists of feature vectors for each PSM, where each feature represents a probability assigned by one of the dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) within the Riptide model. These probabilities are then used to generate a log odds ratio, which helps in discriminating between positive and negative PSMs. The feature vectors can be further analyzed using additional algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) or the Percolator algorithm, to produce scores for the PSMs. These scores are used to improve peptide identification by reducing the false discovery rate.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model, referred to as Riptide, is relatively fast in real-time, taking approximately a minute per spectrum for the databases considered. However, it is slower compared to other commonly used PSM evaluation metrics, such as Xcorr. This is acceptable because there is a long history in MS/MS analysis software of using fast preliminary scores to pre-filter peptides before handing them off to the sensitive, yet expensive, final scoring routines.\n\nThe running time for Riptide to score a given spectrum scales approximately as O(lNpNilog(Ns)), where l is the average length of a peptide, Np is the number of candidate peptides for that spectrum, Ni is the number of ion series under consideration, and Ns is the number of peaks in the particular spectrum.\n\nCurrently, Riptide is implemented in a combination of C++ and Python code, using the GMTK package for dynamic Bayesian network analysis. GMTK is freely available, and the C++ code is available upon request. Future plans include migrating Riptide to C and integrating the code into the sequence database search package Crux. Ultimately, the Crux package will incorporate the probabilities produced by Riptide for PSMs into probabilities for protein identification.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the Riptide model is available upon request. It is implemented in a combination of C++ and Python, utilizing the GMTK package for dynamic Bayesian network analysis. GMTK is freely available. In the near future, plans are in place to migrate Riptide to C and integrate it into the sequence database search package Crux. This integration will allow the Crux package to incorporate the probabilities produced by Riptide for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) into probabilities for protein identification.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved a comprehensive, multi-stage computational pipeline. Initially, candidate peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were generated using a reimplementation of Sequest. These PSMs were then evaluated by our model, Riptide, which produced feature vectors. These vectors were subsequently post-processed using either a support vector machine (SVM) or the semi-supervised learning algorithm Percolator.\n\nFor training, we utilized target and decoy PSMs derived from an E.coli dataset. The model's performance was then assessed using spectra obtained from a yeast whole-cell lysate. This approach allowed us to measure the pipeline's ability to discriminate between target and decoy PSMs effectively.\n\nThe SVM, a binary classifier, was employed to learn the distinction between positive and negative PSMs using the 99-dimensional feature vectors generated by Riptide. After training, test set PSMs were scored based on their distance from the SVM hyperplane. Correct PSMs were expected to receive positive discriminant scores, while incorrect ones were assigned negative scores.\n\nOur evaluation compared the performance of Riptide combined with the SVM against Sequest's XCorr score function. This comparison involved searching each spectrum in the test set against a shuffled decoy version of the protein sequence database. The number of matches to the decoy database at various score thresholds was used to estimate the false identification rate among the target PSMs. For each PSM, a q-value was computed, representing the minimal false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at which the PSM is considered significant. The evaluation focused on identifying the largest number of peptides with the lowest rate of false identifications, a typical goal in mass spectrometry.\n\nIn addition to the static SVM post-processor, we tested Riptide in conjunction with Percolator. Percolator iteratively learns to discriminate between correct and incorrect PSMs using PSMs from a decoy dataset as proxies for incorrect PSMs in the target dataset. We tested three variants of Percolator: using the original 20 features, using Riptide’s 99 features, and combining all 119 features. The results indicated that when Riptide’s feature vectors were combined with those used in the original Percolator publication, there was a 12.4% improvement in positive identifications at a 1% false discovery rate.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focus on the false discovery rate (FDR) as our key performance metric. This is a standard measure in the field of mass spectrometry and proteomics, allowing us to quantify the proportion of incorrect peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) among the total identifications. We report the number of positive peptide identifications as a function of the q-value, which is a measure of the FDR. This approach aligns with common practices in the literature, providing a clear and comparable metric for assessing the performance of our methods.\n\nWe compare the performance of our Riptide scoring function with that of the Sequest scoring function, XCorr, to demonstrate the utility of our support vector machine (SVM) normalized discriminant score function. This comparison is visually represented in Figure 4A, where we plot the number of target PSMs identified against the q-value threshold. This evaluation method is chosen because it closely matches the typical goal of mass spectrometrists: identifying the largest number of peptides with the lowest rate of false identifications.\n\nAdditionally, we test Riptide in conjunction with the semi-supervised learning algorithm Percolator. We evaluate three variants of Percolator: using the original 20 features, using Riptide’s 99 features, and using all 119 features combined. The results, shown in Figure 4B, indicate that combining Riptide’s feature vectors with those used in the original Percolator publication yields a 12.4% improvement in positive identifications at a 1% FDR. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that our performance metrics are both representative and robust, providing a clear picture of our method's effectiveness in real-world applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our method, we performed a comparison with publicly available methods using benchmark datasets. Specifically, we used a tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007), which is publicly available as the 60cm dataset. This dataset consists of 18,149 spectra derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate. The dataset was used to demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across different peptide sets.\n\nWe also compared our method with simpler baselines. For instance, we tested the static SVM post-processor and found that it outperforms Sequest by 10.8% at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Additionally, we tested Riptide in conjunction with the semi-supervised learning algorithm, Percolator. We evaluated three variants of Percolator: using the original 20 features, using Riptide’s 99 features, and using all 119 features. The results showed that combining Riptide’s feature vectors with those used in the original Percolator publication yielded a 12.4% improvement in positives at 1% false discovery rate.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted experiments to understand the performance of different feature sets. The original features from Käll et al. (2007) outperformed the Riptide features when both were used alone. This result is likely due to the use of information in generating Percolator features that is unavailable to Riptide, particularly protein-level information. Thus, Riptide-derived features benefit discrimination most when combined with high-level, non-fragmentation-based information.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method, Riptide, includes a comparison with other algorithms such as Sequest and Percolator. The performance metrics presented, such as the improvement in peptide identification at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR), are derived from experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, Riptide with a static SVM outperforms Sequest by 10.8% at a 1% FDR. This improvement is statistically significant and indicates that our method provides a superior performance in identifying peptides.\n\nAdditionally, we tested Riptide in conjunction with the semi-supervised learning algorithm Percolator. When Riptide’s feature vectors are combined with those used in the original Percolator publication, we observed a 12.4% improvement in positives at a 1% FDR. This result further supports the robustness and reliability of our method.\n\nThe experiments were conducted using a publicly available tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al. (2007), which consists of 18,149 spectra derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate. This dataset was used to validate the model’s ability to generalize across different peptide sets, ensuring that the performance metrics are not specific to a particular dataset.\n\nThe statistical significance of our results is supported by the use of standard evaluation techniques, such as the calculation of q-values, which measure the minimal FDR threshold at which a peptide-spectrum match (PSM) is deemed significant. The q-values provide a reliable measure of the confidence in the peptide identifications, ensuring that the reported improvements are not due to random chance.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics presented in our evaluation are statistically significant and demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing baselines. The use of a publicly available dataset and standard evaluation techniques further supports the reliability and generalizability of our results.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in our study are not publicly available. The evaluation process involved a publicly available tandem MS dataset from Klammer et al.

However, the specific processed files and results from our evaluation are not released publicly. The evaluation focused on demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different peptide sets using this dataset.
