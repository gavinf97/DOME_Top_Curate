  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study is derived from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis of miRNA-gene interactions. The primary sources include the miRTarBase and TarBase databases, which provide experimentally validated miRNA-gene interactions. From miRTarBase, we obtained a set of 360 different miRNAs interacting with 1472 different genes, with strong experimental evidence such as reporter assays or western blots. TarBase contributed an additional set of 136 miRNAs interacting with 798 genes, derived from various experimental methods including microarrays and proteomics.\n\nTo mitigate potential research bias, we also incorporated computational predictions from the TargetScan Human software. This involved querying all known human miRNAs and applying stringent filters to minimize false positives. The filtering process reduced the initial predictions to a more reliable set of 1355 genes and 548 human miRNAs. The union of empirically validated and computationally predicted interactions resulted in a dataset of 788 different human miRNAs interacting with 2954 different genes.\n\nThis dataset has been used to assess the biological roles of genes that interact with miRNAs, combining knowledge from publicly available databases and data mining tools. The analysis includes an overrepresentation analysis to identify significant biological pathways and gene ontology terms associated with these interactions. The dataset is part of a broader effort to understand the higher-level organization of gene products into biological pathways, with the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledge base serving as the gold standard.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main subsets, labeled A and B, using an ABC analysis approach. This method involves plotting the fraction of the largest number of miRNA per gene interactions against the fraction of the number of miRNAs per genes. The splitting point for sets A and B was determined by finding the minimum distance from the ABC curve to the point of strongest inequality, which is (0,1).\n\nSet A contains 23% of all miRNAs, specifically 181 miRNAs. These miRNAs influence 75% of all genes, totaling 2,227 genes, of which 2,169 are unique. This indicates that a small subset of miRNAs interacts with a large number of genes.\n\nSet B, on the other hand, contains the remaining 77% of miRNAs, which is 607 miRNAs. These miRNAs influence only 25% of the genes. This distribution highlights that many miRNAs target only a few genes, with a significant portion (304 out of 788 miRNAs) interacting with just one gene.\n\nThe ABC analysis helps address the potential bias caused by the unequal distribution of miRNA interactions, ensuring a more balanced evaluation of miRNA-gene interactions.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm belongs to the class of iterative methods used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in statistical models, particularly those with latent variables.\n\nThe EM algorithm is not new; it was introduced by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin in 1977. It is a well-established method in the field of statistics and has been widely applied in various domains, including machine learning and bioinformatics.\n\nThe reason the EM algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal in this context is that our primary focus is on the application of this algorithm to model the distribution of miRNA-target interactions. The innovation lies in how we applied and adapted the EM algorithm to address specific challenges in our study, rather than in the development of a new algorithm. The algorithm's application is tailored to the biological context, aiming to derive meaningful insights from the data related to miRNA and gene interactions.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze and predict miRNA-gene interactions based on TargetScan scores. The GMM is used to model the distribution of these scores, with different Gaussian components representing varying probabilities of interaction.\n\nThe approach involves using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the parameters of the GMM. This algorithm is employed to handle incomplete data and to find maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the Gaussian components.\n\nThe model does not integrate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Rather, it focuses on the TargetScan scores and empirically validated interactions to derive its predictions. The validation process involves comparing the modeled distributions of TargetScan scores with those of empirically validated interactions, ensuring the reliability of the predictions.\n\nThe independence of the training data is not explicitly discussed in the context provided. However, the use of empirically validated interactions suggests an effort to ensure that the data used for training and validation are distinct, thereby maintaining the independence necessary for robust model performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps to prepare the miRNA-target gene interaction predictions for analysis. Initially, we utilized the TargetScan Human software (version 6.2) to predict miRNA versus gene interactions. This software provided numerical values known as \"total context+ scores\" (TCP scores) for a vast number of interactions. These scores were derived by considering multiple aspects of miRNA versus gene interactions, including site type, site number, site location, 3' pairing, local AU base pair content, and seed-pairing stability.\n\nTo facilitate further analysis, the TCP scores were transformed into a positive range and zero-invariant logarithmic form, resulting in what we termed \"Logarithmic TargetScan Scores\" (LTS). This transformation was achieved using the formula LTS = log((−100 ∙ TCP) + 1). The LTS values were then analyzed using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with three Gaussian components. The parameters of this model were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.\n\nThe distribution of LTS scores was modeled to distinguish between interactions of varying validity. The first Gaussian component represented interactions with low or moderate probability, while the third Gaussian component indicated interactions with strong plausibility. This modeling allowed us to derive a threshold for acceptable predictions, ensuring that only interactions with a high likelihood of validity were considered.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the LTS scores with empirically validated interactions from databases such as TarBase and miRTarBase. This comparison helped in validating the predictions made by TargetScan and in setting a lower limit for LTS values to minimize false-positive results. The final set of acceptable predictions was filtered to include only those interactions that met stringent criteria, resulting in a reliable dataset of miRNA-gene interactions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze the logarithmic TargetScan scores. The GMM is defined by three primary parameters for each Gaussian component: the mean (mi), the standard deviation (si), and the relative weight (wi). Given that our model consists of three Gaussian components, the total number of parameters (p) used in the model is nine.\n\nThe selection of the number of Gaussian components (M = 3) was guided by the nature of the data and the specific research questions we aimed to address. The three components were chosen to represent different levels of interaction plausibility between miRNAs and target genes. The first Gaussian component captures LTS values around zero, indicating no reasonable gene versus miRNA interaction. The second component describes interactions of uncertain validity, while the third component represents scores with strong plausibility of indicating a gene/miRNA interaction.\n\nThe parameters of the GMM were adapted to the data using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This iterative method is well-suited for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables, ensuring that our parameters accurately reflect the underlying data distribution. The EM algorithm was applied to both the entire set of TargetScan LTS scores and the subset of empirically validated interactions, allowing us to compare and validate our model's predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "The optimization process involved the use of specific input features derived from the TargetScan Human software, version 6.2. The primary input feature used was the \"total context+ score\" (TCP score), which combines contributions from six different aspects of miRNA versus gene interactions. These aspects include site type, site number, site location, 3' pairing, local AU base pair content, and seed-pairing stability.\n\nThe TCP scores were transformed into \"Logarithmic TargetScan Scores\" (LTS) using a logarithmic transformation. This transformation was applied to all TCP scores, resulting in a distribution that could be modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with three Gaussian components. The parameters of this model were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by focusing on the LTS scores that indicated a higher probability of miRNA-gene interactions. Specifically, a threshold of LTS > 3.06 was derived to filter out predictions with a lower likelihood of valid interactions. Additionally, to minimize false positives, only predictions with at least two different LTS scores above a threshold of 4.06 were accepted. This restrictive filtering resulted in 6,805 acceptable predictions for miRNA/gene interactions, involving 1,355 different genes.\n\nThe distribution of miRNA versus gene interactions was further analyzed to address potential biases. The set of miRNAs was split into two disjoint subsets, A and B, using an ABC analysis. This analysis helped in understanding the unequal distribution of miRNA interactions with genes, where a small subset of miRNAs interacted with many genes, while a large subset interacted with only one gene. The ABC analysis ensured that the results were not biased by this unequal distribution.\n\nIn summary, the input features used in the optimization process were the TCP scores transformed into LTS scores. Feature selection was performed by setting thresholds on the LTS scores to filter out low-probability interactions and by using the ABC analysis to address distribution biases. All feature selection steps were conducted using the entire dataset, ensuring that the training set was not separately used for this purpose.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involves the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze the distribution of TargetScan scores and empirically validated interactions. The GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each characterized by parameters including mean, standard deviation, and relative weight. These parameters were optimized using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.\n\nThe number of parameters in the GMM is relatively small compared to the number of training points. Specifically, the GMM has three components, each with three parameters (mean, standard deviation, and weight), totaling nine parameters. This is significantly smaller than the number of training points, which includes 371,557 TargetScan predictions and 4,229 empirically validated interactions. Therefore, the risk of overfitting is mitigated by the large number of data points relative to the number of parameters.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of the model, the quality of the fit was assessed using quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. These plots compare the distribution of the data to the theoretical distribution of the GMM, providing a visual check for the goodness of fit. The coincidence of the data points with the straight line in the Q-Q plots indicates that the model adequately captures the underlying distribution of the data, ruling out both overfitting and underfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the model's validity was confirmed through empirical validation. The distribution of empirically validated interactions was compared to the distribution of all TargetScan predictions. The results showed that the validated interactions had a higher probability density at the high end of the LTS values, confirming that the model accurately identifies interactions with strong plausibility. This empirical validation step provides further evidence that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our findings. One key approach was the use of conservative statistical methods throughout our analyses. We applied Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, which helps to control the family-wise error rate and reduces the likelihood of false positives.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated computational predictions of miRNA/gene interactions using TargetScan, which were filtered rigorously to minimize false positives. This involved setting a stringent threshold for acceptable predictions and requiring at least two different predictions with a score above this threshold for a miRNA/gene interaction to be considered valid.\n\nTo address potential biases due to the unequal distribution of miRNA interactions with genes, we performed an ABC analysis. This method split the set of miRNAs into two subsets based on their interaction patterns, allowing us to assess the consistency of our results across different subsets of data.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted a ten-fold repeated experiment where genes were randomly chosen to validate the significance of our overrepresentation analysis. This approach helped to ensure that the observed functional areas were not due to random chance but represented genuine biological insights.\n\nBy combining these techniques, we aimed to enhance the reliability and generalizability of our findings, providing a comprehensive and precise description of the biological processes influenced by miRNAs.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported in the supplementary materials. Specifically, the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) used to analyze the distribution of the Logarithmic TargetScan Scores (LTS) are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. This table provides the mean, standard deviation, and relative weight of each of the three Gaussians in the mixture model.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly detailed in the provided materials. However, the methods used for optimization, such as the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, are referenced. The EM algorithm was employed to optimize the parameters of the GMM, ensuring that the model accurately represented the data.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of these configurations and parameters, the supplementary materials are typically made available alongside the publication. Researchers can access these materials to replicate the study or build upon the findings. The specific licensing terms would depend on the journal's policies and the institutional guidelines under which the research was conducted. Generally, such materials are shared under terms that allow for academic use and further research.\n\nFor those interested in the detailed implementation, the supplementary materials provide a comprehensive overview of the methods and parameters used, facilitating reproducibility and further exploration.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent one, as it utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to interpret the TargetScan LTS scores. The GMM provides a clear probabilistic framework for understanding the likelihood of miRNA-gene interactions.\n\nThe GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each representing different levels of interaction plausibility. The first Gaussian, with a mean around 1.25, indicates LTS values suggesting no reasonable gene-miRNA interaction. The second Gaussian, with a mean around 2.6, describes interactions of uncertain validity. The third Gaussian, with a mean around 3.4, represents scores with a strong plausibility of indicating a gene-miRNA interaction.\n\nThis model allows for a straightforward interpretation of the LTS scores. For instance, an LTS score above 3.06 is associated with a higher probability of a valid miRNA-gene interaction, as derived from the maximum likelihood approach comparing empirical validated interactions and all TargetScan predictions. Furthermore, a threshold of 4.06 is set to minimize false positives, ensuring that only interactions with a high degree of confidence are considered acceptable.\n\nThe use of Bayes' theorem further enhances the interpretability by providing a posterior probability that a miRNA interacts with a gene based on the LTS score. This probabilistic approach offers a clear and transparent method for evaluating the reliability of predicted interactions.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is evident through the use of a GMM with well-defined Gaussian components, clear thresholds for acceptable predictions, and a probabilistic framework for interpreting LTS scores. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are interpretable and reliable.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model, designed to predict the likelihood of interactions between microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes. The core of the model is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is used to estimate the probability density function of the TargetScan LTS (logarithmic TargetScan) scores. These scores are indicative of the strength of miRNA-gene interactions.\n\nThe GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each representing different levels of interaction probability. The first Gaussian, with a mean around 1.3, suggests low or no interaction. The second Gaussian, with a mean around 2.6, indicates interactions of uncertain validity. The third Gaussian, with a mean around 3.4, represents scores with a strong plausibility of indicating a genuine miRNA-gene interaction.\n\nTo classify the interactions, a Bayesian approach is utilized. The posterior probability of an interaction being in the third Gaussian component is calculated, which provides a measure of the likelihood that a given LTS score indicates a true interaction. This posterior probability is then used to set a threshold for acceptable predictions. Specifically, a threshold of LTS > 3.06 is derived, above which the probability density function of empirically validated interactions exceeds that of all TargetScan scores. This threshold helps in minimizing false positive predictions.\n\nAdditionally, to further ensure the reliability of the predictions, a more stringent criterion is applied: a miRNA-gene interaction is only accepted if there are at least two different predictions with LTS scores above the threshold of 4.06. This restrictive filtering results in a set of 6,805 acceptable predictions for miRNA-gene interactions, involving 1,355 different genes. This approach aims to provide a high-confidence set of interactions, reducing the likelihood of false positives.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model that uses a GMM and Bayesian probabilities to predict and validate miRNA-gene interactions, with stringent criteria to ensure the reliability of the predictions.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model primarily involved the optimization of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This process was applied to both the entire dataset of TargetScan predictions and the subset of empirically validated interactions. The EM algorithm iteratively refined the parameters of the GMM, which included means, standard deviations, and weights for three Gaussian components. While specific execution times were not detailed, the process was computationally intensive due to the large number of predictions (over 371,000) and the need for iterative optimization. The model's execution time would have been influenced by the computational resources available, but it is clear that the EM algorithm played a crucial role in determining the model's parameters efficiently. The resulting GMM provided a probabilistic framework for assessing the likelihood of miRNA-gene interactions, with a lower limit of LTS scores established to filter out less reliable predictions.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithms used in this study is not publicly released. However, the computational predictions of miRNA-targeted genes were performed using publicly available software. Specifically, the TargetScan Human software (version 6.2) was utilized for predicting miRNA versus gene interactions. This software is widely used in the field and is accessible to the research community.\n\nAdditionally, the calculations were conducted using the Matlab software, which is a commercial product developed by MathWorks. While Matlab itself is not open-source, it is a standard tool in many scientific and engineering disciplines, and its use ensures reproducibility of the results presented in this study.\n\nFor the density estimation and modeling of the distribution of the TCP scores, the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) kernel density estimation method was employed. This method is described in the literature and can be implemented using various statistical software packages.\n\nThe empirical validation of miRNA versus gene interactions was performed by querying the TarBase and mirTarBase databases, which are publicly accessible resources. These databases contain experimentally validated interactions and were used to compare and validate the predictions made by the TargetScan software.\n\nIn summary, while the specific source code for the algorithms is not publicly available, the methods and tools used are well-documented and accessible, ensuring that the results can be reproduced and validated by other researchers in the field.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved a comprehensive analysis of miRNA-gene interactions using both empirical and computational data. We utilized overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to assess the biological roles of genes interacting with miRNAs. For this, we employed a p-value threshold of 1.0 × 10^-3 with Bonferroni α correction. The ORA for gene set A, which included miRNAs with strong experimental evidence, reproduced all functional areas present in the union of gene sets A and B with a maximum p-value of 1.0 × 10^-16 and a median p-value of 1.0 × 10^-16. This set reproduced 15 out of 17 functional areas with a maximum p-value of 1.0 × 10^-4 and a median p-value of 1.0 × 10^-13. The functional areas \"biological adhesion\" and \"response to stimulus\" were not significant at the p-value threshold for gene set B.\n\nTo quantify the performance, we calculated precision and recall for all possible values of the p-value threshold. Precision was defined as the fraction of terms in the ORA for gene set A that are also in the union of gene sets A and B versus the number of terms in the ORA for gene set A. Recall was defined as the fraction of terms in the ORA for gene set A that are also in the union of gene sets A and B versus the number of terms in the ORA for the union of gene sets A and B. The values of recall and precision at the largest F-measure gave a recall of 69% and a precision of 95% for gene set A. For gene set B, the recall was 77% and the precision was 81%. These measurements demonstrate that the results of the ORA of the gene subsets A and B coincide to a sufficiently large extent with the ORA of all miRNA-influenced genes considered in this work.\n\nAdditionally, we performed a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot analysis to ensure the quality of our model. The Q-Q plot of the distribution of all TargetScan LTS scores and the empirically validated miRNA versus gene interactions showed a good coincidence with the straight line, confirming the reliability of our predictions.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the quality and reliability of our predictions. Specifically, we reported precision and recall, which are fundamental metrics in evaluating the performance of predictive models.\n\nPrecision, also known as the positive predictive value, measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted interactions) among all positive predictions made by the model. It indicates how many of the predicted interactions are actually correct. Recall, or sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives (known interactions). It indicates how well the model can identify all relevant instances.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation, we also calculated the F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F-measure gives a single score that balances both precision and recall, providing a more holistic view of the model's performance. We determined the values of recall and precision at the largest F-measure, which gave us a recall of 69% and a precision of 95% for gene set A. For gene set B, the recall was 77% and the precision was 81%.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature and are representative of standard practices in evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of bioinformatics and gene interaction studies. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a clear and transparent assessment of our model's performance, allowing for comparisons with other studies and ensuring that our results are robust and reliable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our methods with publicly available tools and simpler baselines to ensure robustness and accuracy. For instance, we directly compared the modeled distributions for TargetScan scores with empirically validated interactions. This comparison involved plotting the probability density functions for both predicted and validated miRNA/gene interactions, providing a visual representation of how our model's predictions align with real-world data.\n\nAdditionally, we performed overrepresentation analysis (ORA) on different gene sets, including those with experimentally shown and computationally predicted miRNA interactions. This allowed us to assess the precision and recall of our methods against established benchmarks. The results demonstrated that our approach achieved high precision and recall, indicating its effectiveness in identifying relevant miRNA-target interactions.\n\nWe also calculated precision and recall for all possible values of the p-value threshold, using the largest F-measure to determine the optimal balance between these metrics. This rigorous evaluation process ensured that our methods were not only accurate but also reliable in practical applications.\n\nFurthermore, we compared our findings with simpler baselines to understand the added value of our more complex models. This included evaluating the performance of our methods against basic statistical approaches and ensuring that our advanced techniques provided significant improvements in prediction accuracy and reliability.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In the \"Evaluation Confidence\" subsection, we assessed the reliability and statistical significance of our predictions. We employed a probabilistic approach using Bayes' theorem to estimate the likelihood that a predicted miRNA-gene interaction is valid. This method provided a p-value for each prediction, indicating the probability that the interaction occurs by chance. We set a stringent threshold of p < 0.02 to ensure high confidence in our predictions, which corresponds to a LTS score threshold of 4.06.\n\nTo further minimize false positives, we required at least two different predictions with LTS scores above this threshold for a miRNA-gene interaction to be considered acceptable. This restrictive filtering resulted in 6,805 high-confidence predictions involving 1,355 genes. The use of the ABC analysis helped address potential biases due to the unequal distribution of miRNA-gene interactions, ensuring a more balanced evaluation.\n\nThe statistical significance of our method was supported by the comparison of modeled distributions for TargetScan scores and empirically validated interactions. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot and the probability density function (pdf) demonstrated a strong coincidence with the expected distributions, validating the quality of our model. Additionally, the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) confirmed the plausibility of our LTS score threshold, providing further confidence in our evaluation metrics.\n\nWhile we did not explicitly report confidence intervals for our performance metrics, the stringent thresholds and statistical methods used ensure that our results are robust and statistically significant. The approach taken allows us to claim with high confidence that our method provides superior and reliable predictions of miRNA-gene interactions compared to baselines.",
