  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study comprises subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV). These CNVs were mapped to genes using transcript coordinates based on RefSeq hg18, ensuring consistency with the BeadChip arrays used. The performance of the analysis was similar when using a more stringent exonic mapping, which required at least one exon to be overlapped by a CNV.\n\nThe dataset includes a curated set of neurally-relevant genes, which were selected based on various criteria such as predicted haploinsufficiency, brain expression levels, synaptic complex membership, and implication in neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases. These genes were compiled from multiple sources, including the Human Phenotype Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and Gene Ontology annotations.\n\nThe total number of subjects in the study is 1,892. The dataset was divided into three equal subsets for cross-validation, each containing the same proportion of cases (ASD subjects) and controls. This stratified three-fold cross-validation approach was employed to avoid overfitting and to ensure robust performance estimation.\n\nThe dataset has been used in previous analyses and by the community, as indicated by the references to supplementary methods and results. The cross-validation strategy involved training the model on the union of two subsets and testing it on the remaining subset, repeating this process three times so that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. This procedure was iterated twenty times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), providing a comprehensive assessment of the classification performance.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three equal subsets for cross-validation purposes. Each subset maintained the same proportion of ASD and control subjects. Two of these subsets were used as the training set for the model, while the remaining subset served as the validation set to quantify performance. This process was iterated three times, ensuring that each subset was used twice for training and once for validation. Additionally, the cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean performance and its standard deviation. The remaining set, not used in the cross-validation, was used as a test set to assess the final performance of the classification.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into three equal subsets, each containing the same proportion of ASD and control subjects. This division was done to ensure that the data was stratified, which helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that each subset is representative of the overall dataset. The cross-validation strategy involved using two of these subsets for training the model, while the remaining subset was used as the validation set to quantify performance. This process was iterated three times, so that each subset was used twice for training and once for validation. Additionally, the cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean performance and its standard deviation.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed independently for each training set to avoid overfitting. This means that the features selected for the model were based on the relevance metrics calculated on the training data subset used for that particular iteration. This approach ensures that the training and test sets remain independent, as the feature selection does not rely on information from the test set.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in terms of feature relevance and classification performance was compared to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of ASD research. The challenges addressed in this study, such as the high degree of mutual overlap among features and the presence of many features with limited or no classification relevance, are common in large and complex biological datasets. The use of feature selection strategies like Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), MDA with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) helped to mitigate these issues and improve the classification performance. The results showed that incorporating feature selection steps significantly enhanced the model's ability to distinguish between ASD and control subjects, particularly when using gene ontology (GO) and pathway-based features.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is ensemble learning, specifically tree-based methods. Two main classifiers were employed: Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Inference Forest (CF). RF was initially chosen for its resilience to overfitting and its ability to handle a large feature space. However, CF was later preferred due to its slightly higher performance in certain classifications and its ability to mitigate the positive selection bias towards features with more categorical values that RF exhibits.\n\nNeither RF nor CF are new algorithms. They are well-established methods in the field of machine learning. The choice to use these algorithms in this context was driven by their suitability for the specific problem at hand, which involves classifying subjects based on genetic data. The focus of the publication is on the application of these algorithms to genetic data for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, it is appropriate for this work to be published in a medical genomics journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The emphasis is on the biological insights and the practical application of these methods to genetic data, rather than the innovation of new machine-learning techniques.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs individual machine-learning algorithms to classify subjects based on specific features. The primary classifiers used include Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CF), a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Neural Network (NN). Each of these classifiers was evaluated independently to assess their performance in classifying subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on various genetic features.\n\nThe Random Forest and Conditional Inference Forest classifiers were particularly highlighted for their robustness and ability to handle large feature spaces. The performance of these classifiers was compared using a set of 20 curated neurally-relevant features, along with the total gene count. The Conditional Inference Forest was found to have a slightly higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) than the Random Forest when classifying all subjects, but a slightly lower AUC for de novo and pathogenic subjects.\n\nThe linear SVM and Neural Network were also evaluated using the same cross-validation strategy and feature set. The results indicated that these classifiers achieved comparable or lower AUC than the Conditional Inference Forest. Additionally, the performance of Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features was assessed, but these features did not outperform the curated neurally-relevant features.\n\nThe training data for each classifier was divided using a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy to avoid overfitting. This approach ensured that the data was split into training and test sets in a way that maintained the same proportion of cases and controls in each subset. The process was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the AUC, providing a robust assessment of the classifiers' performance.\n\nIn summary, the model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input; rather, it relies on individual classifiers trained on specific genetic features. The training data for each classifier is independent, as ensured by the cross-validation strategy.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were tailored to the specific requirements of each classifier. For the Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Forest (CF) classifiers, no explicit feature normalization or scaling was required. These classifiers were implemented using the R/CRAN packages 'randomForest' and 'party', respectively, with default settings unless otherwise specified. The feature relevance metrics utilized for RF included Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini, which were calculated using the randomForest package. MDA was determined by permuting the value of the feature in out-of-bag (OOB) samples and comparing the accuracy of prediction before and after permutation tree by tree. Mean Decrease Gini measured how each feature contributed to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves.\n\nFor the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to being input into the classifier. The libSVM package was used in MATLAB R2013a, with the cost parameter kept at the default value of 1 and class weights kept even.\n\nThe Neural Network (NN) was built with two middle layers consisting of 100 and 50 nodes each. It was trained using back-propagation and did not require feature normalization or scaling. The learning rate was set to 0.005, affecting the rate of connection weight adaptation, and a momentum of 0.9 was used to accelerate the connection weight adaptation. The NN was also implemented in MATLAB R2013a.\n\nFeature selection strategies were employed to manage the large number and redundancy of features, particularly for Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features. These strategies included MDA-based selection, MDA-based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (MRMR). For each procedure, the top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features were selected, excluding the total gene count, which was then added back. Feature selection was performed independently for every training set to avoid overfitting issues.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized several parameters to optimize the performance of our models. Specifically, we assessed the impact of different test statistics and mincriterion values on classification performance. The test statistic parameters included options like Quadratic and Max, while the mincriterion values were set at 0.95, 0.75, and 0.5. These parameters were crucial for tree construction in our models, ensuring that features used met a certain threshold of relevance.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by their ability to improve classification accuracy and robustness. For instance, we observed that modifying the mincriterion value had a minor effect on performance, with default settings often yielding the best results. This indicates that the chosen parameters were effective in balancing model complexity and performance.\n\nAdditionally, we employed feature relevance metrics such as Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini to rank and select features. These metrics helped in identifying the most relevant features for model training, thereby reducing dimensionality and improving classification performance. The number of features selected varied, with top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features being considered, excluding the total gene count and then adding it back.\n\nOverall, the parameters used in our models were carefully chosen and optimized to enhance classification accuracy and robustness, ensuring that the models performed well across different datasets and conditions.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a variety of features derived from Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and pathways. Initially, we faced challenges due to the high mutual overlap among features and the presence of many features with limited or no classification relevance. To address these issues, we performed classification using all features and also embedded a feature selection step within the cross-validation procedure. The feature selection methods employed included Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) based selection, MDA based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) Feature Selection. For each of these procedures, we selected the top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features, excluding the total gene count, and then added the total gene count back into the feature set.\n\nIt is crucial to note that feature selection was conducted based on feature relevance metrics calculated on the data subset used for training. This process was performed independently for every training set to avoid overfitting issues. This approach ensured that the selected features were relevant and contributed to the classification performance without biasing the results.\n\nThe number of features used as input varied depending on the selection method and the percentage of top-ranking features chosen. However, the final set of features for classification included a subset of the initially considered features, refined through the feature selection process. This refinement helped in managing the large number and redundancy of GO and pathway-based features, although their information content for ASD classification based on rare CNV genes appeared to be more limited compared to the curated neurally-relevant features.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy to mitigate overfitting. This approach involved dividing subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV) into three equal subsets, each maintaining the same proportion of cases and controls. The model was trained on the union of two subsets and tested on the remaining subset, a process repeated three times without re-dividing the dataset. This ensured that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. To further estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), we performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations. This method helped model the classification stochasticity and assess the absence of overfitting.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, we also replaced real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This step was crucial in verifying that our models did not merely memorize the training data but could generalize to new, unseen data. For the 20 curated neurally-relevant features, the AUC obtained using randomization was similar to the AUC of the total gene count, indicating no evidence of overfitting.\n\nFor the neural network and linear support vector machine (SVM), Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features produced better performance than using conditional inference forests (CF), but they were still inferior to the 20 curated features. However, there was potential evidence of some modest degree of overfitting for GO and pathway-based features. The AUC for random features exceeded by more than one AUC absolute unit (and more than two AUC standard deviation units) the AUC for the total gene count only, and was also very close to the AUC of real Gene Ontology features.\n\nRegarding underfitting, we ensured that our models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, the neural network was built with two middle layers of 100 and 50 nodes each, and it was trained through back-propagation. The linear SVM used a cost parameter kept at the default value of 1, and each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to being input into the classifier. These configurations helped in achieving a balance between model complexity and generalization performance, thereby avoiding underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classification models. One of the primary methods used was stratified three-fold cross-validation. This approach involved dividing the subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV) into three equal subsets, each maintaining the same proportion of cases and controls. The model was trained on the union of two subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This process was repeated three times, ensuring that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. To further account for stochasticity, we performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations, which allowed us to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC).\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the absence of overfitting by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This technique helped us to verify that the performance of our models was not due to overfitting but rather to the genuine relevance of the features used.\n\nFor feature selection, we utilized Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (MRMR). These methods helped in selecting the most relevant features while minimizing redundancy, thereby enhancing the model's performance and reducing the risk of overfitting. The feature selection was performed independently for every training set to avoid any overfitting issues.\n\nMoreover, we compared the performance of different feature selection strategies, including using all features, MDA-based selection, MDA-based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and MRMR. This comprehensive approach ensured that our models were optimized for classification performance while mitigating the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, details about the classifiers, including the random forest (RF), conditional inference forest (CF), linear support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN), are provided. For instance, the RF implementation details mention the use of the R/CRAN package ‘randomForest’ version 4.6-7 with default settings unless otherwise specified. Similarly, the CF implementation details refer to the R/CRAN package ‘party’ version 1.0-9, also with default settings unless otherwise specified.\n\nFor the linear SVM, the libSVM package in MATLAB R2013a was used with a default cost parameter of 1 and even class weights. Each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to input into the classifier. The neural network was built with two middle layers of 100 and 50 nodes each, a learning rate of 0.005, and a momentum of 0.9. The network was trained through back-propagation and did not require feature normalization or scaling.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly detailed in the main text but are implied through the description of the cross-validation strategy. Stratified three-fold cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting, with subjects divided into three equal subsets. The union of two subsets was used to train the model, while the remaining subset was used as the test set. This process was repeated three times without re-dividing the dataset, ensuring each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set.

  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study exhibit varying degrees of interpretability. The Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Forest (CF) classifiers are generally considered more interpretable than black-box models. This is because they provide feature relevance metrics that can help understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.\n\nFor RF, two feature relevance metrics were utilized: Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini. MDA measures the impact of permuting a feature's values on the model's accuracy, providing insight into how important each feature is for making accurate predictions. Mean Decrease Gini, on the other hand, assesses how each feature contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the trees, indicating its importance in the decision-making process.\n\nCF also uses MDA for feature selection, which helps in ranking features based on their importance. This allows for a clear understanding of which features are most influential in the model's decisions.\n\nIn contrast, the Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are more opaque. While the NN was trained through back-propagation and does not require feature normalization or scaling, the internal workings of how it combines features to make predictions are not straightforward to interpret. Similarly, the SVM, despite its effectiveness, does not provide clear insights into feature importance.\n\nOverall, while the RF and CF models offer transparency through their feature relevance metrics, the NN and SVM remain more black-box in nature. This makes RF and CF more suitable for scenarios where interpretability is crucial, allowing researchers to understand the underlying factors contributing to the model's predictions.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. We utilized various classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CF), linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), to classify subjects based on the presence of rare copy number variants (CNVs). The primary goal was to distinguish between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) subjects and controls. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the percentage of correctly classified subjects. The CF classifier, in particular, demonstrated robust performance and was used extensively in our analyses. The model's output provides insights into the predictive power of different types of CNVs and features, contributing to the understanding of genetic factors associated with ASD.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study utilized a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy to mitigate overfitting. The dataset was divided into three equal subsets, each maintaining the same proportion of cases and controls. Two of these subsets were used to train the model, while the remaining subset served as the test set to evaluate classification performance. This process was repeated three times, ensuring that each subset was used once as the test set and twice as part of the training set. To account for the stochastic nature of classification, twenty independent cross-validation iterations were performed. This approach allowed for the estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), providing a robust measure of model performance.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of overfitting was further assessed by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This step helped to validate that the model's performance was not merely due to chance or artifacts in the data. The cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean performance and its standard deviation, ensuring the reliability of the results. The evaluation also included different feature selection strategies, such as using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and pathways, to assess their impact on classification performance. The results were quantified using metrics like AUC, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily reported the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as our performance metric. This metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of classification models, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets, which is common in genetic studies. The AUC provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, in this case, between subjects with and without certain genetic conditions.\n\nWe calculated the AUC using a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy. This approach helps to ensure that our results are robust and not due to overfitting. We performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the AUC, providing a measure of the model's performance variability.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported the percentage of correctly classified subjects. This metric is particularly relevant in our study, as it provides a direct measure of the model's ability to correctly identify subjects with specific genetic conditions. We calculated this percentage as the number of subjects correctly predicted in at least 15 out of 20 iterations divided by the total number of subjects in the study.\n\nWe also assessed the performance of our models using different gene sets and feature selection methods. For instance, we compared the performance of models using 20 curated neurally-relevant features, Gene Ontology (GO) features, and pathway-based features. This comparison allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of different feature selection strategies and to identify the most informative features for our classification task.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of the literature in the field of genetic classification. The AUC is a standard metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, and the percentage of correctly classified subjects provides a direct measure of the model's practical utility. Our use of cross-validation and the reporting of performance variability further enhance the robustness and interpretability of our results.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our methods with both publicly available techniques and simpler baselines to ensure robustness and validity. We employed a cross-validation strategy where the dataset was divided into three equal subsets, each containing the same proportion of ASD and control subjects. Two of these subsets were used for training the model, while the remaining subset served as the validation set for performance quantification. This process was iterated three times, ensuring that each subset was used twice for training and once for validation. The feature selection was specifically applied to GO and pathway-based features, with the remaining set used as the test set to assess classification performance.\n\nWe compared our results with those obtained using linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN), utilizing the same cross-validation strategy and the 20 curated neurally-relevant features. Both the linear SVM and NN achieved comparable or lower AUC than our method, indicating that our approach outperformed these alternatives. Importantly, we did not find evidence of overfitting, as the AUC obtained using the randomization of the 20 curated neurally-relevant features was similar to the AUC of the total gene count.\n\nFor both the neural network and the linear SVM, GO and pathway-based features produced better performance than using CF, yet still inferior to the 20 curated features. However, we found potential evidence of some modest degree of overfitting for GO and pathway-based features, as the AUC for random features exceeded by more than one AUC absolute unit (and more than two AUC standard deviation units) the AUC for the total gene count only, and was also very close to the AUC of real Gene Ontology features.\n\nAdditionally, we tested different inferential statistics used by CF for tree construction and observed minor differences in performance. The default settings (Teststat = max, Testtype = Teststatistic) usually had the best performance, or performance was similar to other settings. This consistency across different settings further supports the reliability of our method.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our classification approach includes a robust assessment of confidence in the performance metrics. We employed stratified three-fold cross-validation to ensure that our results are not due to overfitting. This method involves dividing the subjects into three equal subsets, each with the same proportion of cases and controls. The model is trained on two subsets and tested on the remaining one, a process repeated three times so that each subset is used once as the test set and twice as the training set. This process was repeated twenty times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), providing a measure of the classification stochasticity.\n\nThe performance metrics, such as AUC, are presented with standard deviations, which indicate the variability and confidence intervals of the results. For instance, the AUC values for different classifiers and feature sets are accompanied by standard deviations, allowing for an assessment of the statistical significance of the differences observed. This approach ensures that the reported performance metrics are reliable and that the claimed superiority of certain methods over others is statistically significant.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the absence of overfitting by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This step is crucial in verifying that the observed performance is not due to chance but rather to the genuine predictive power of the features used. The results showed that the AUC obtained using randomized features was similar to the AUC of the total gene count, further confirming the robustness of our findings.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation confidence is high due to the use of rigorous cross-validation strategies, the inclusion of standard deviations in performance metrics, and the assessment of overfitting through randomization tests. These measures ensure that the reported results are statistically significant and that the methods evaluated are superior to the baselines.",
