  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from a collection of drugs known to interact with specific transporters, namely OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2. These transporters are part of the SLC22 family, which is known for handling a diverse range of compounds. The dataset includes approximately 250 drugs, each characterized by their physicochemical properties. These properties were calculated using computational chemistry software such as ICM and tabulated using the KNIME workflow platform. The dataset focuses on drugs that exhibit high-affinity interactions with these transporters, with a particular emphasis on non-overlapping drugs, i.e., those that interact with only one transporter at a high affinity.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the drugs were determined using about 50 attributes calculated with ICM, including molecular quantum numbers, atom counts, bond counts, polarity counts, and topology counts. Additionally, around 100 chemical features were added using KNIME with extensions from RDKit, Indigo, and CDK, such as molecular weight, molecular volume, Log P, Log S, and polar surface area. A class variable was also included to represent the specific transporter with which each drug interacts.\n\nThe dataset leverages inhibition (Ki) data, which is more readily available compared to transport (Km) data. This choice is consistent with the broader field of SLC and ABC drug transporters, where inhibition data is commonly used due to its availability. The dataset has been used to perform systematic computational and statistical analyses, as well as machine-learning analyses, to understand the functional differences between the transporters and the physicochemical properties that influence their interactions with ligands. The results of these analyses have been validated through various machine-learning models, including decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, decision rules, and naïve Bayes.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "In our study, we focused on creating a robust dataset for machine-learning analyses by ensuring that the datasets were split appropriately to maintain independence between training and test sets. We conducted six pairwise comparison studies: OAT1 versus OCT1, OAT1 versus OCT2, OAT3 versus OCT1, OAT3 versus OCT2, OAT1 versus OAT3, and OCT1 versus OCT2. For each comparison, we eliminated \"overlapping\" drugs, which are those that displayed high-affinity interactions with both of the transporters being compared. This step was crucial to ensure that the datasets were independent and that the models could accurately distinguish between the transporters based on the physicochemical properties of the drugs.\n\nThe elimination of overlapping drugs helped in creating distinct datasets for each pairwise comparison, thereby enforcing independence between the training and test sets. This approach ensured that the models were not biased by drugs that interacted with multiple transporters, which could otherwise confound the results.\n\nRegarding the distribution of our datasets compared to previously published machine-learning datasets, our approach of using nonoverlapping drugs for each comparison is a strength. It allows for a more precise identification of the physicochemical descriptors that separate the transporters. This method ensures that the models are trained on drugs that are specific to each transporter, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. The use of a large dataset, despite the limitations, was experimentally validated and is reasonable given the structural diversity of the compounds handled by the transporters. As more data becomes available and machine-learning techniques continue to improve, the clarity of the chemical features enabling transport by different SLC and/or ABC transporters is expected to increase.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and widely recognized in the field. These include decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. These algorithms are implemented using the Weka machine-learning software, which is an open-source collection of machine-learning algorithms developed by the University of Waikato.\n\nThe algorithms employed are not new; they have been extensively used and validated in various scientific and machine-learning applications. The decision to use these established algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in classification tasks and their ability to provide interpretable models, which is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of transporter binding and interaction.\n\nThe choice of algorithms was also influenced by the need for models that could help explain the data rather than just classify it. For instance, while neural network models are highly accurate classifiers, they are often considered \"black box\" models because they do not provide clear insights into the decision-making process. In contrast, decision tree and decision rule models offer a more interpretable structure, making them preferable for this study.\n\nThe use of these algorithms in a biological context, specifically for studying transporter selectivity, is what sets this work apart. The focus is on applying these machine-learning techniques to a specific biological problem, rather than developing new algorithms. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the physicochemical properties that influence drug-transporter interactions, which is the primary goal of the study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The optimization process involved multiple machine-learning algorithms, but it did not explicitly use a meta-predictor approach where the output of one model serves as input to another. Several different machine-learning models were employed, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. Each of these models was used to develop classification models that could help explain transporter binding/interaction data.\n\nDecision trees were particularly useful because they are interpretable, with each node representing a variable and each branch representing a data split based on the value of that variable. Random forests, which are ensembles of decision trees, were also used. These forests were trained with different bootstrap samples, and the ensemble was averaged to produce an aggregate classification. The trees within the random forest were slightly decorrelated by limiting the choice of variables during tree induction, which allowed for different combinations of variables to fill out the tree branches.\n\nThe use of multiple machine-learning methods demonstrated that there is a boundary related to transporter selectivity. Different decision trees were generated within a given model, depending on the features selected, which was likely due to the overlap in molecular characteristics captured by various attributes. Multiple iterations of the algorithms and parameters were explored to arrive at models with the best validation scores.\n\nStatistical tests were also conducted to study the significance of the calculated differences between ligand transporter interactions. T-tests were performed on the physiologic properties to determine if the differences in the mean values for each were statistically significant between the two groups of drugs. The physiologic properties were then ranked according to their P-values.\n\nIn summary, while various machine-learning methods were used, there was no explicit meta-predictor that combined the outputs of these models. Instead, each model was developed and validated independently, with a focus on understanding the physicochemical properties that affect transporter interactions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, drugs were categorized based on their net charge as cationic, anionic, neutral, or zwitterionic neutral. The percentage of each charge species was determined using pH/concentration curves at pH values of 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6. This resulted in the calculation of total positive, negative, neutral, and zwitterionic neutral species percentages for individual charge-species bar diagrams.\n\nFor the machine-learning analyses, the study focused on nonoverlapping drugs, which interacted with high affinity for only one transporter. Physicochemical properties of the drugs were calculated using ICM and tabulated in KNIME, an open-source workflow platform for machine-learning. About 50 physicochemical attributes, including molecular quantum numbers, atom counts, bond counts, polarity counts, and topology counts, were calculated using ICM. Additionally, approximately 100 chemical features for each drug, such as molecular weight, molecular volume, Log P, Log S, and polar surface area, were added using KNIME extensions capable of collecting data from RDKIT, Indigo, and CDK.\n\nA class variable was also included to represent the transporter with which a given drug would interact. The raw data extracted from KNIME and ICM contained some attributes that were overlapping, empty, or constant, and these were eliminated. Weka's attribute-selection feature, Chi Square Evaluator, was used to rank the attributes according to their contribution to predicting the class variable. This involved binarizing real-valued variables and testing the expected-minus-observed counts with respect to the class.\n\nAfter preprocessing, machine-learning algorithms were employed to develop models. Drugs with high affinity for the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2 were treated as instances, and their physicochemical properties were used as attributes. Six pairwise comparison studies were conducted, excluding overlapping drugs that displayed high-affinity interaction with both of the transporters being compared. Several Weka machine-learning models, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks, were used to develop well-validated classification models.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, multiple physicochemical properties of drugs were used as attributes or input parameters for the machine-learning models. These properties included charge-related factors, such as the number of positive and negative charges, as well as other physicochemical features like the number of acyclic double bonds, acyclic oxygens, acyclic nitrogens, and the SP3 character, which indicates the three-dimensionality of the drug molecules.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by their importance in distinguishing between drugs that interact with different transporters. Initially, charge state information was found to be dominant in classifying drugs. However, to explore the role of other physicochemical properties, decision trees were constructed excluding charge properties. This process helped identify additional key determinants, such as the number of acyclic double bonds, acyclic oxygens, and the SP3 character.\n\nMultiple iterations of the algorithms and parameters were explored to arrive at models with the best validation scores. The final set of parameters used in the models was determined through a combination of statistical analysis and machine-learning techniques, ensuring that the most relevant properties were included. The number of parameters varied depending on the specific model and the transporters being compared, but generally, the most important variables were identified and used to build the models.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a comprehensive set of physicochemical properties was initially considered as input features. Approximately 50 attributes were calculated using ICM, encompassing molecular quantum numbers, atom counts, bond counts, polarity counts, and topology counts. Additionally, around 100 chemical features were added through the KNIME platform using RDKit, Indigo, and CDK, including molecular weight, molecular volume, Log P, Log S, and polar surface area.\n\nFeature selection was performed to refine the input features. The Chi Square Evaluator in Weka was used to rank the attributes according to their contribution to predicting the class variable. This procedure involved binarizing real-valued variables and testing the expected-minus-observed counts with respect to the class, ensuring that the selected features were non-independent and contributed significantly to the model's predictive power. This feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and testing phases remained unbiased.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the primary methods used was cross-validation, specifically 10-fold cross-validation. This process involved dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This procedure was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach helped to ensure that the models were not overfitting to the training data and provided a more reliable estimate of their performance.\n\nAdditionally, decision trees were pruned to improve performance. Pruning involves removing parts of the tree that provide little power in classifying instances. This technique helps to simplify the model and reduce the likelihood of overfitting by eliminating branches that capture noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.\n\nRandom forests, which are ensembles of decision trees, were also utilized. These models incorporate bootstrap sampling and variable decorrelation, which help to reduce overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data. The random forest approach further enhances the robustness of the models by considering the importance of different variables and their interactions.\n\nIn summary, cross-validation, decision tree pruning, and the use of random forests were key techniques employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the reliability of our machine-learning models.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study encompass both transparent and black-box approaches. Decision trees and decision rules are among the most interpretable models used. In a decision tree, each node represents a variable, and each branch signifies a data split based on the variable's value. This structure allows for a clear, step-by-step path that leads to a class prediction, making it easy to understand the decisions made by the model. For instance, in the comparison between OAT1 and OCT1, the decision tree might first split based on the number of acyclic divalent nodes, classifying drugs with zero such nodes as OCT1 drugs. Subsequent splits might consider other attributes like the number of acyclic double bonds or acyclic oxygens, providing a transparent view of how different physicochemical properties influence the classification.\n\nRandom forests, while slightly more complex, also offer interpretability through variable importance plots. These plots rank the significance of various attributes in predicting transporter interactions, with charge state information often dominating. Following charge, attributes like the number of acyclic double bonds, acyclic oxygens, and SP3 character are highlighted, indicating their importance in distinguishing between different transporter interactions. This approach ensures that the model's decisions are not entirely opaque, as the contribution of each variable can be assessed.\n\nIn contrast, neural network models are considered black-box models. While they are highly accurate classifiers, they lack the transparency of decision trees and random forests. Neural networks do not provide a clear, interpretable path for how inputs lead to outputs, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the classifications. However, their accuracy makes them valuable for predictive purposes, even if the decision-making process remains less clear.\n\nOverall, the preference for models that can explain transporter binding/interaction data is evident. Decision trees and random forests, with their interpretable structures and variable importance rankings, are favored for their ability to provide insights into the physicochemical properties that influence transporter selectivity. This transparency is crucial for understanding the underlying biology and for validating the models with experimental data.",
  "model/output": "The models developed in this study are primarily classification models. They were designed to distinguish between drugs that have a high affinity for specific transporters (OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2) based on their physicochemical properties. Various machine-learning algorithms, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks, were employed to create these classification models. The goal was to identify which attributes of the drugs were most important in determining their interaction with these transporters. The models were validated to ensure their accuracy and reliability in classifying the drugs.\n\nDecision trees were particularly useful in this context because they provide an interpretable way to understand the decisions made by the model. Each node in a decision tree represents a variable, and each branch represents a data split based on the value of that variable. This structure allows for a clear path to a class prediction, making it easier to explain the transporter binding/interaction data.\n\nRandom forest models, which are an ensemble of decision trees, were also used. These models improve classification accuracy by averaging the results of multiple trees, each trained on different bootstrap samples. The random forest approach also helps in estimating the importance of different variables, providing insights into which physicochemical properties are most influential in determining transporter selectivity.\n\nIn summary, the models developed are classification models that use various machine-learning techniques to predict the interaction of drugs with specific transporters based on their physicochemical properties. Decision trees and random forests were particularly useful due to their interpretability and ability to handle complex data.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the specific algorithms and models used in this study is not publicly released. However, several open-source tools and platforms were utilized throughout the research process. These include:\n\n* ICM (Molsoft LLC, San Diego, CA), a commercially available computational chemistry software.\n* Chemicalize software (ChemAxon, Cambridge, MA), used for creating pH/concentration curves.\n* KNIME, an open-source workflow platform for machine-learning, which includes extensions for collecting data from notable open-source cheminformatics toolkits such as RDKIT, Indigo, and CDK.\n* Weka, an open-source collection of machine-learning algorithms developed by the University of Waikato.\n\nThese tools are available under their respective licenses and can be accessed through their official websites. The specific models and algorithms developed in this study, however, are not provided as standalone software or executable files. The methods and results are detailed in the publication to allow for reproducibility and further research.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the machine-learning models involved several rigorous steps to ensure their validity and reliability. Initially, the models were developed using drugs that exhibited high affinity for specific transporters, with their physicochemical properties serving as attributes. To avoid bias, drugs that showed high-affinity interaction with more than one transporter in pairwise comparisons were excluded from the analysis.\n\nMultiple machine-learning algorithms were employed, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. The preference was for models that could explain transporter binding/interaction data, with decision trees and decision rules being particularly favored due to their interpretability. Neural networks, while accurate classifiers, were considered less useful for defining distinguishing properties due to their \"black box\" nature.\n\nThe models were validated through cross-validation procedures, where trees were induced and then pruned to improve performance. This process helped in ensuring that the models were not overfitting the data. The success rates of different algorithms were comparable, indicating a clear boundary related to transporter selectivity.\n\nIn addition to machine-learning approaches, statistical tests were conducted to study the significance of calculated differences between ligand-transporter interactions. T-tests were performed on the physiologic properties to determine if the differences in mean values were statistically significant between the two groups of drugs. The physiologic properties were then ranked according to their P-values.\n\nThe evaluation also included experimental validation. For instance, a pharmacophore model for OAT3 was used for virtual screening, identifying potential new OAT3 cationic ligands. Six top hits were selected and tested in wet laboratory transport assays. Four of these ligands were found to interact with OAT3, with strong inhibition of tracer uptake, while only two showed lower affinity interaction with OAT1. This experimental validation supported the findings from the machine-learning analysis and the pharmacophore models.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method combined computational, statistical, and experimental approaches to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models developed.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our machine-learning models, several performance metrics were reported to assess the effectiveness of the classifiers. The primary metric used was the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area, which provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different classes. This metric was calculated for each of the six pairwise comparison studies: OAT1 versus OCT1, OAT1 versus OCT2, OAT3 versus OCT1, OAT3 versus OCT2, OAT1 versus OAT3, and OCT1 versus OCT2. The ROC areas were determined using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the results were robust and not dependent on a particular subset of the data.\n\nThe ROC area is a well-established metric in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in the context of drug-transporter interactions. It provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance across all threshold levels, making it a reliable indicator of the model's discriminative power. Additionally, the ROC area is less sensitive to class imbalances compared to other metrics, such as accuracy, which is crucial given the varying numbers of high-affinity drugs for different transporters.\n\nIn addition to the ROC area, the models were also evaluated based on their validation performance. Models that demonstrated good validation scores were preferred, as they indicated the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This is particularly important in the context of drug-transporter interactions, where the goal is to identify physicochemical properties that can predict transporter selectivity.\n\nThe use of ROC areas and validation performance metrics is representative of standard practices in the field of machine learning and drug discovery. These metrics have been widely used in the literature to evaluate the performance of classification models, ensuring that our results are comparable to other studies in this domain. The focus on these metrics allows for a clear and concise evaluation of the models' effectiveness in distinguishing between different transporter interactions.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed several machine-learning algorithms to develop models for distinguishing drugs based on their affinity for specific transporters. The algorithms used included decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, but our focus was on models that could provide insights into the physicochemical properties influencing transporter binding.\n\nDecision trees were particularly useful because they offer interpretability. Each node in a decision tree represents a variable, and each branch represents a data split based on the value of that variable. This structure allows for a clear understanding of how different physicochemical properties contribute to the classification of drugs. Decision trees were induced by ranking variables based on their ability to split the data effectively, and the process was repeated for each branch until the nodes mostly reflected one class or the other. Pruning was applied to improve performance in cross-validation.\n\nRandom forests, an ensemble of decision trees, were also utilized. Each tree in a random forest is trained with different bootstrap samples, and the ensemble is averaged to produce an aggregate classification. This method decorrelates the trees by limiting the choice of variables during induction, which helps in estimating the importance of variables and their interactions. The random forest approach provides a robust measure of variable importance, considering both main effects and interactions.\n\nStatistical tests, such as t-tests, were performed to study the significance of differences between ligand-transporter interactions. These tests helped in ranking physiologic properties based on their P-values, providing a statistical foundation for the machine-learning analyses. The attributes with the lowest P-values were consistent with the findings from the machine-learning models, reinforcing the reliability of our results.\n\nIn summary, our methods comparison involved using multiple machine-learning techniques and statistical analyses to ensure robust and interpretable results. Decision trees and random forests were particularly valuable for their ability to provide insights into the physicochemical properties that influence transporter binding. The consistency between statistical tests and machine-learning models further validated our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the machine-learning models employed in this study involved several key aspects that contribute to the confidence in the results. Multiple machine-learning algorithms were used, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. The performance of these models was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, which helps to ensure that the results are robust and not dependent on a particular subset of the data.\n\nThe performance metrics, such as the weighted-average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) areas, provide a quantitative measure of the models' effectiveness. These metrics were calculated for various pairwise comparisons of transporters, and the results are summarized in a table. The ROC areas indicate the models' ability to distinguish between different classes of drugs based on their physicochemical properties.\n\nStatistical tests, such as t-tests, were performed to study the significance of the calculated differences between ligand transporter interactions. These tests helped to identify which physicochemical properties were statistically significant in distinguishing between the transporters. The attributes with the lowest P values were considered the most important, and these were consistent with the findings from the machine-learning analyses.\n\nThe decision trees and random forests provided not only classification success but also a logical way to demonstrate how physicochemical properties of the ligands affect the binding interaction between ligands and transporters. The models were validated, and the results showed that there are analyzable boundaries related to transporter selectivity.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics have confidence intervals implied by the cross-validation process, and the results are statistically significant. The use of multiple algorithms and the consistency of the findings across different methods enhance the confidence in the superiority of the approach.",
