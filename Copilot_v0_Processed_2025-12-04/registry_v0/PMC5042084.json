  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study consists of two main parts. Firstly, we benchmarked our method on the PSICOV set, which comprises 150 single-domain monomeric proteins. This set has been widely used as a benchmark for various contact prediction methods in the community. Additionally, we tested our method on a set of 434 chains from smaller protein families with known experimental structures. This dataset allowed us to evaluate the performance of our method across a diverse range of protein families. The median number of effective sequences in the original PSICOV test set was over 600, but our method demonstrated robust performance even with fewer sequences, requiring only around 200 effective sequences to achieve competitive results. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in handling datasets with varying depths of sequence alignments.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized multiple datasets to evaluate the performance of our methods. For the MetaPSICOV benchmark, we used a set of 150 single-domain monomeric proteins from the PSICOV set, which has been widely adopted as a benchmark for various contact prediction methods. Additionally, we tested MetaPSICOV on a set of 434 chains from smaller protein families with known experimental structures. This dataset allowed us to assess the performance of our method across a diverse range of protein families.\n\nIn the CASP11 experiment, we focused on 40 domains in the contact prediction category. Our server achieved an average precision of 27% across all these targets. The median number of effective sequences calculated using our approach was 44. The number of effective sequences was determined from the original alignments generated by the server and truncated to the domain boundaries used in the assessment.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis, we examined seven outliers with more than 250 effective sequences and precision below 40%. These targets were reanalyzed by constructing alignments only for the assessed domains in isolation. This approach led to a drop in the number of effective sequences by 200 to 400 for six of the seven targets, resulting in an average increase in prediction precision due to the removal of drifted or misaligned sequences.\n\nIn summary, our datasets included a benchmark set of 150 proteins, a larger set of 434 chains from smaller protein families, and 40 domains from the CASP11 experiment. The distribution of data points varied, with the CASP11 dataset having a median of 44 effective sequences per domain. The reanalysis of outliers highlighted the importance of domain-specific alignments for improving prediction accuracy.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work is based on neural networks, specifically a two-stage neural network predictor. This approach is not entirely new, as neural networks have been widely used in machine learning for various applications, including contact prediction in proteins. The first stage of our neural network uses a comprehensive set of features, including covariation-based methods and classical contact prediction features, to generate an initial contact map. The second stage refines this map by eliminating outliers and filling in gaps, resulting in a more accurate contact probability estimate for each pair of residues.\n\nThe decision to use neural networks in this context is driven by their ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and to learn intricate patterns from large datasets. Neural networks have proven to be effective in capturing the non-linear relationships between residues in protein sequences, which is crucial for accurate contact prediction. The use of a two-stage neural network allows for a more refined and accurate prediction by iteratively improving the contact map.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our work is on the application of these techniques to protein structure prediction, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Our primary contribution lies in the integration of multiple covariation methods and classical features within a neural network framework to enhance contact prediction accuracy. This application-specific focus is more aligned with journals in the field of bioinformatics and structural biology, where the practical implications of these methods are of primary interest.",
  "optimization/meta": "The MetaPSICOV method is indeed a meta-predictor, combining multiple sources of information to enhance contact prediction precision. It integrates three distinct covariation methods—PSICOV, mfDCA, and GREMLIN—each representing different approaches to solving the statistical decoupling problem in residue covariation-based contact predictions. These methods produce partially overlapping results, ensuring a diverse set of contact predictions.\n\nIn addition to these covariation methods, MetaPSICOV utilizes classical machine learning-based contact prediction features. These features include amino acid profiles, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and sequence separation predictions. The classical features, while having less predictive power than the covariational features, play a crucial role in cases where multiple sequence alignments generated for the query sequence have little depth.\n\nThe meta-predictor operates in two stages. The first stage involves a neural network that processes a combination of classical contact prediction features and the outputs from the three covariation methods. The second stage takes the output of the first stage, which is an 11x11 window of the full contact map, and analyzes it to eliminate outliers and fill in gaps in the contact map. The total number of features used in the second stage is 731.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is not explicitly stated whether the training data for the different methods are completely independent. However, the use of different statistical approaches in the covariation methods suggests that the data sources are diverse, which helps in producing non-overlapping sets of contacts. This diversity is a key aspect of the MetaPSICOV method, as it allows for a more comprehensive and accurate contact prediction.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process for our machine-learning algorithm involved a combination of classical contact prediction features and covariation methods. We utilized amino acid profiles, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and sequence separation as classical features. For covariation, we employed three distinct methods: PSICOV, which uses sparse inverse covariance estimation; mfDCA, based on the mean-field approximation of a maximum entropy inverse Potts model; and GREMLIN, which operates within a pseudolikelihood maximization framework. These covariation methods were chosen to represent different approaches to solving the statistical decoupling problem, ensuring that the results were only partially overlapping.\n\nThe first stage of our neural network predictor processed these features, generating an 11 x 11 window of the full contact map. The second stage analyzed this output to eliminate outliers and fill in gaps, using a total of 731 features. This two-stage approach allowed us to integrate diverse sources of information, enhancing the precision of contact predictions.\n\nTo handle redundancy in large multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), we calculated effective sequence counts (Neff) rather than raw sequence numbers. We clustered protein sequences at a 62% identity threshold, similar to the BLOSUM62 matrix used in BLAST, and used the number of clusters as the Neff value. This step ensured that our alignments were deep and diverse, crucial for reliable contact predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 731 features are used as input. These features are derived from a combination of covariation methods and classical machine learning-based contact prediction features. The covariation methods include PSICOV, mfDCA, and GREMLIN, each representing different approaches to solving the statistical decoupling problem in residue covariation-based contact predictions. Additionally, classical features such as amino acid profiles, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and sequence separation are included. These classical features, while having less predictive power than the covariational features, play a crucial role in cases where multiple sequence alignments generated for the query sequence have little depth.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. However, the combination of different feature types and the use of a two-stage neural network predictor suggest a form of implicit feature selection, where the network learns to weigh the importance of different features based on the input data. The first stage of the neural network processes an 11x11 window of the full contact map, while the second stage analyzes this output to eliminate outliers and fill in gaps, effectively refining the feature set. This approach ensures that the most relevant features are utilized for accurate contact predictions.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our approach, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our contact prediction method. One key aspect was the use of a two-stage neural network predictor. The first stage incorporated a variety of features, including covariation methods and classical contact prediction features. This stage generated an initial contact map, which was then refined in the second stage. The second stage analyzed the output of the first stage to eliminate outliers and fill in gaps, effectively smoothing the contact map and reducing the likelihood of overfitting to noise in the data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized effective sequence calculations to handle redundancy in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). By clustering sequences at a 62% identity threshold, we ensured that the alignments used for contact prediction were diverse and informative, rather than being dominated by redundant sequences. This step helped in reducing overfitting by providing a more representative sample of the sequence space.\n\nAnother important regularization technique was the tuning between classical and covariation features based on the depth of the input alignment. For shallow alignments, where covariation signals are weak, the method down-weighted the covariation features and relied more on classical features. Conversely, for deep and diverse alignments, the covariation features were given more importance. This adaptive approach helped in balancing the contributions from different types of features, thereby improving the generalization ability of the model.\n\nFurthermore, we separated short-range and long-range contact potentials in our structure prediction framework. This separation ensured that the contributions from short-range contacts, which are more abundant and easier to predict, did not overwhelm the impact of long-range contacts. By scaling the contact potentials according to the predicted contact probability, we were able to achieve a better balance and improve the overall precision of the contact predictions.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study, MetaPSICOV, is not entirely a black box. It combines classical contact prediction features with three distinct covariation-based methods within a neural network framework. This hybrid approach allows for a degree of interpretability.\n\nOne key aspect of MetaPSICOV's transparency is its ability to modulate the relative impact of covariation-based and classical features depending on the quality and depth of the multiple-sequence alignment (MSA). For shallow alignments, covariation features are down-weighted, whereas for deep and diverse alignments, covariation features become dominant. This adaptive mechanism provides insight into how the model adjusts its predictions based on the input data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance can be analyzed by examining the changes in contact prediction precision when realigning domain sequences. For instance, in the case of target T0826-D1, the contact prediction precision significantly increased after realigning the sequence, solely because the sequence alignment was no longer anchored to the C-terminal domain. This example illustrates how specific adjustments in the alignment process can directly influence the model's output, offering a clearer understanding of its decision-making process.\n\nFurthermore, the model's success in handling multi-domain proteins highlights its interpretability. The analysis of outliers suggests that processing multi-domain proteins per-domain improves prediction accuracy. This insight into the model's behavior when dealing with complex protein structures adds to its transparency.\n\nIn summary, while MetaPSICOV leverages advanced neural network techniques, it incorporates mechanisms that allow for a degree of interpretability. The model's adaptive feature weighting, sensitivity to alignment adjustments, and handling of multi-domain proteins provide clear examples of its transparency.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model, specifically designed for residue-residue contact prediction in proteins. It predicts whether pairs of residues in a protein sequence are in contact with each other. The output of the model is a contact map, which indicates the likelihood of contacts between residue pairs. This contact map is generated using a two-stage neural network predictor that combines classical contact prediction features with three distinct covariation methods. The first stage of the network processes an 11x11 window of the full contact map, while the second stage analyzes this output to eliminate outliers and fill in gaps in the contact map. The final output is a set of contact probabilities for every pair of residues, which can be used to guide protein structure prediction. The model's performance is evaluated based on the precision of these contact predictions, particularly for long-range contacts.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The CONSIP2 server, which implements the MetaPSICOV method, is publicly available. The server accepts whole target sequences and processes them to generate contact predictions. It utilizes a hybrid sequence alignment protocol that combines HHblits and jackHMMer to identify as many homologous sequences as possible. The output multiple sequence alignment is then passed to MetaPSICOV for contact prediction.\n\nThe MetaPSICOV method itself combines classical contact prediction features with three distinct covariation methods embedded in a two-stage neural network predictor. This approach allows for increased contact prediction precision and enables reliable predictions even for sequences with shallow multiple sequence alignments.\n\nThe CONSIP2 server is accessible for use, and the method has been described in detail in previous publications. The server's pipeline and the MetaPSICOV method are designed to be robust and efficient, making them valuable tools for protein structure prediction.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated through benchmarking on established datasets and participation in the CASP11 experiment. Benchmarking involved testing on the PSICOV set of 150 single-domain monomeric proteins and a set of 434 chains from smaller protein families with known experimental structures. This evaluation showed that the method outperformed both the consensus of individual covariation methods and classical neural network-based contact prediction, regardless of the number of effective sequences in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Additionally, the method was found to perform on par with any single covariation method but required fewer effective sequences.\n\nIn CASP11, the method was applied to a set of 40 target domains with a median family size of around 40 effective sequences. The server achieved an average top-L/5 long-range contact precision of 27%. The evaluation highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, including the importance of constructing deep and diverse MSAs and the challenges posed by transmembrane domains and sequence coverage criteria. The method's performance was also discussed in the context of de novo structure prediction, emphasizing its ability to improve model accuracy with predicted contact information.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on precision as our key performance metric for contact prediction. Specifically, we reported the average precision across all targets in the contact prediction category. For instance, in the CASP11 experiment, our server achieved an average precision of 27% across 40 domains. This metric is widely used in the literature and provides a clear indication of the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed the performance of our method in terms of the number of effective sequences (N_eff), which accounts for redundancy in multiple sequence alignments. We found that our method performs well with approximately 200 effective sequences and above. This is a crucial metric because it helps understand the minimum data required for reliable predictions.\n\nWe also examined the top-L/5 long-range contacts, which are contacts that are at least five residues apart in the sequence. The prediction accuracy for these contacts reaches a plateau at around 300 effective sequences, giving a mean precision of approximately 80%. This metric is important because long-range contacts are often more informative for protein structure prediction.\n\nIn some cases, we recalculated the effective sequence counts and precision values using only the domain sequence, which provided insights into how our method performs on individual domains within multi-domain proteins. This approach helped us identify and address issues related to sequence coverage and alignment quality.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we used is representative of the standards in the field. Precision is a common metric for evaluating contact prediction methods, and the use of effective sequences helps account for the variability in the quality of multiple sequence alignments. The focus on long-range contacts is also aligned with the literature, as these contacts are particularly valuable for structural biology applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our MetaPSICOV method against both publicly available methods and simpler baselines. We benchmarked MetaPSICOV on the PSI-COV set of 150 single-domain monomeric proteins, which has been widely used as a benchmark for other contact prediction methods. Additionally, we tested MetaPSICOV on a set of 434 chains from smaller protein families with known experimental structures. Our findings demonstrated that MetaPSICOV outperformed the consensus of three individual covariation methods and classical contact prediction methods, regardless of the number of effective sequences in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). We also showed that MetaPSICOV performs on par with any single covariation method, requiring only 200 effective sequences, compared to the over 600 effective sequences needed by the median of the original PSICOV test set. For top-L/5 long-range contacts, the prediction accuracy reaches a plateau at around 300 effective sequences, achieving a mean precision of approximately 80%.\n\nIn the context of CASP11, we developed the CONSIP2 server, which is based on the MetaPSICOV method. We compared our server's performance against other contact prediction methods in the CASP11 experiment. On a set of 40 target domains with a median family size of around 40 effective sequences, our server achieved an average top-L/5 long-range contact precision of 27%. This performance was obtained by combining classical contact prediction features with three distinct covariation methods embedded in a two-stage neural network predictor. Our approach also includes a hybrid method to generate the deepest possible multiple-sequence alignments by combining jackHMMer and HHblits.\n\nWe also compared our method to simpler baselines, such as classical contact prediction methods based on support vector machines or neural networks. These methods do not require large alignments and can be used for challenging free modeling (FM) targets but suffer from low precision. Our MetaPSICOV method addresses this by incorporating covariation-based methods, which significantly improve contact prediction precision and enable reliable predictions for sequences with shallow multiple sequence alignments.",
