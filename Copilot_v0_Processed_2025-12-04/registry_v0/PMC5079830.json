  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study primarily comes from the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced (DUD-E) dataset. This dataset is notable for its large size, encompassing 102 targets, over 20,000 active molecules, and more than a million decoy molecules. The DUD-E dataset is particularly valuable for its extensive coverage, although it lacks protein-ligand structures, which we addressed by using docked poses for training our models.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the ChEMBL bioactivity database to extract compounds with published activity for the HSP90 alpha target. Specifically, we collected 355 active compounds from the ChEMBL3880 target, which had IC50 values expressed in nM units and a pChEMBL greater than zero. These compounds were used to create our ligand-based regression models.\n\nFor the MAP4K4 dataset, we had 30 compounds, all with co-crystal structures, but only 18 of these had measured IC50 data. This dataset is particularly useful for evaluating pose prediction performance.\n\nThe DUD-E dataset has been widely used in the community for virtual screening and docking studies due to its comprehensive nature. Our approach involved using docked poses from DUD-E to train structure-based models, which allowed us to leverage the large amount of high-throughput screening data available. This method framed the problem as a classification between binders and non-binders, normalizing for different assay outcomes and utilizing binding data in a structure-based approach.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "In our study, we utilized the DUD-E dataset to generate structural training sets. This dataset is notable for its large size, encompassing 102 targets, over 20,000 active molecules, and more than a million decoy molecules. The dataset was split into different subsets to evaluate various training approaches. We created a balanced set with equal numbers of decoy and active compounds to enhance the signal from the active set. Additionally, we extracted a target-specific set for HSP90 from these larger training sets.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the training and test sets, we employed a classification approach that leveraged high-throughput screening data. This approach involved docking ligands to generate protein-ligand structures, resulting in a large but noisy dataset. The training sets were constructed using docked poses, with the top-ranked pose selected for each ligand. This method helped to normalize for different assay outcomes and provided a robust framework for evaluating the performance of our machine learning models.\n\nThe distribution of our training sets differs from previously published machine learning datasets in that it includes a significant number of decoy molecules, making it highly imbalanced. This imbalance was addressed by creating a balanced subset, which improved the performance of our models. The use of the DUD-E dataset, with its extensive collection of decoys, allowed us to evaluate the feasibility of training set construction approaches and compare different methods for enhancing the signal from active compounds.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in our study, including the data splits, are not publicly released in a forum. The code used to build our models is available under a permissive open source license at a specific repository. This code can be used to replicate the models and the approach described in the supplementary information. However, the actual datasets, such as the DUD-E dataset and the specific splits used for training and testing, are not made publicly available. This is because the DUD-E dataset itself is not openly accessible and requires proper licensing and permissions for use. Therefore, while the methodology and tools are shared, the specific data splits and the dataset are not publicly released.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in our study fall into two main classes: parametric and non-parametric methods. Parametric methods include linear regression, which was employed to parameterize empirical scoring functions. Non-parametric methods, such as neural networks, were also utilized for their greater flexibility and expressiveness, allowing them to learn both model structure and parameters from data.\n\nThe neural network model we implemented is not entirely new but was tailored for our specific application. It consists of a single hidden layer with 20 nodes and uses sigmoid activation in the hidden layer along with a softmax function for output normalization. This model was trained using stochastic gradient descent with an inverse learning rate decay function and momentum to minimize the multinomial logistic loss. The choice to use this particular architecture and training method was driven by the need to handle the large, noisy dataset of docked poses effectively.\n\nThe reason this neural network model was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our work was on applying machine learning techniques to the specific problem of protein-ligand interaction scoring, rather than on developing novel machine-learning algorithms. Our primary goal was to evaluate the performance of these methods in the context of drug design and virtual screening, which is more aligned with the scope of journals in computational chemistry and molecular modeling. The neural network served as a tool to achieve this goal, and its implementation details were included to ensure reproducibility and transparency in our methodology.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the models could effectively learn from the input features. We utilized several types of descriptors to represent the molecular structures and their interactions.\n\nFor the ligand-based regression models, we employed various chemical fingerprints generated using RDKit. These fingerprints included default RDKit fingerprints, unfolded path fingerprints, and circular ECFP6 fingerprints. These fingerprints encode the structural and chemical properties of the ligands in a binary format, which serves as the input features (X) for our predictive linear models.\n\nIn the structure-based classification workflow, we transformed each protein-ligand pose into a numerical vector of interaction features. These features were computed using smina and custom code. The custom code was primarily used to calculate descriptors that included a solvent accessible surface area (SASA) term, which smina does not compute. The interaction features encompassed a wide range of terms, including steric, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and electrostatic interactions. Partial charges for electrostatic interactions were computed using Open Babel. Additionally, we included non-interaction count/summation terms and the AutoDock Vina score, resulting in a total of 61 features for each protein-ligand pose.\n\nTo handle the imbalanced nature of our training dataset, which was dominated by decoy molecules, we created a balanced dataset with equal numbers of active and decoy compounds. This balancing step was essential to enhance the signal exhibited by the active set and to improve the model's ability to distinguish between binders and non-binders.\n\nFor internal validation, we used clustered cross-validation, where the training set was partitioned at the target granularity into multiple folds. This approach provided a greater measure of generalizability, as trained models were tested on entirely new targets.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding process involved converting molecular structures into numerical vectors using chemical fingerprints and interaction features. Preprocessing steps included balancing the dataset and using clustered cross-validation for robust model evaluation. These steps ensured that our machine-learning algorithms could effectively learn from the input data and make accurate predictions.",

Additionally, we included non-interaction count/summation terms and the AutoDock Vina score.\n\nFor the selection of parameters, we employed an internal cross-validation approach. This method involved partitioning the training set into multiple folds to ensure that the models were tested on entirely new targets, thereby providing a greater measure of generalizability. Specifically, we used clustered cross-validation to evaluate the models' ability to properly rank compounds. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used as the primary metric for evaluation. A perfect ranking of ligands would produce an AUC of 1.0, while a random ranking would result in an AUC of 0.5.\n\nFor the linear regression model, we found that both linear regression and logistic regression produced nearly identical results in our cross-validation analysis. Given that linear models are faster to evaluate and train, have more interpretable coefficients, and produce a wider range of prediction values, we selected a linear regression model for our submission.\n\nFor the neural network model, we trained a neural net with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy). The model used sigmoid activation in the hidden layer and a softmax function to normalize the output. Training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. Class weights were applied when computing the loss to balance the influence of negative examples with the underrepresented positive examples. The 10-fold cross-validated AUC for the model was 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of 61 features as input for our models. These features were derived from protein-ligand interactions and included various terms such as steric, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and electrostatic interactions. Additionally, we incorporated the AutoDock Vina score and custom-calculated descriptors like solvent accessible surface area (SASA) terms.\n\nFeature selection was inherently performed through the use of regularization techniques in our Elastic Net linear model. This model includes both L1 and L2 regularization factors, which drive some weight values to zero, effectively reducing the number of selected features. This process helps in mitigating overfitting by simplifying the model.\n\nThe regularization parameters were set using an internal cross-validation approach, ensuring that the feature selection was performed using only the training set. This method helps in identifying the best parameters for the training data, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability and performance.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed both parametric and non-parametric machine learning methods, each with its own set of considerations regarding overfitting and underfitting.\n\nFor the parametric methods, such as linear regression and elastic net, the number of parameters is typically much smaller than the number of training points. This inherently reduces the risk of overfitting. However, to further mitigate this risk, we used regularization techniques. Specifically, the elastic net model includes both L1 and L2 regularization factors, which help to drive weight values to zero, thereby reducing the number of selected features and minimizing overfitting. We also applied internal cross-validation to identify the best regularization parameters for the training set, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nFor the non-parametric methods, such as neural networks, the risk of overfitting is higher due to their increased flexibility and expressiveness. To address this, we employed rigorous validation techniques, including clustered cross-validation, where the training set was partitioned at a target granularity into multiple folds. This approach provides a greater measure of generalizability since trained models are tested on entirely new targets. Additionally, for the neural network model, we used class weights to balance the influence of negative examples with the underrepresented positive examples, which helps in handling the imbalanced dataset.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, the neural network model was trained with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes, which provided enough capacity to learn from the data without being too simplistic. Furthermore, we evaluated multiple models and selected the one that performed best in cross-validation, ensuring that the model was neither too simple nor too complex.\n\nIn summary, we carefully balanced the complexity of our models to avoid both overfitting and underfitting. Regularization, cross-validation, and model selection were key strategies employed to achieve this balance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in our predictive models. Specifically, we used the Elastic Net linear model, which incorporates both L1 and L2 regularization factors. These factors help to control the degree of regularization, driving weight values towards zero and thereby reducing the number of selected features. This approach minimizes overfitting by simplifying the model, albeit at the cost of reduced expressiveness. To determine the optimal regularization parameters, we applied internal cross-validation. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data by evaluating its performance on different subsets of the training set. Additionally, we utilized clustered cross-validation for internal validation, which partitions the training set at a target granularity into multiple folds. This technique provides a robust measure of generalizability, as trained models are tested on entirely new targets.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the code used to build the models is available under a permissive open-source license at a specified GitHub repository. This repository likely contains the necessary details for reproducing the experiments, including optimization parameters and schedules. The specific license type is not mentioned, but it is described as permissive, which typically allows for free use, modification, and distribution.\n\nFor the neural network model, specific details about the configuration are provided. The model used a single hidden layer with 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy). It employed sigmoid activation in the hidden layer and a softmax function to normalize the output. Training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. The optimization used stochastic gradient descent with an inverse learning rate decay function and momentum to minimize the multinomial logistic loss. These details should be sufficient for reproducing the neural network model.\n\nFor the linear regression model, default parameters from the scikit-learn library were used, which are well-documented and readily available. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation, indicating its performance and stability.\n\nIn summary, while the exact optimization parameters and schedules are not fully detailed, the provided information and the open-source code repository should enable reproduction of the models and experiments. The neural network configuration is explicitly described, and the linear regression model uses standard, well-documented parameters.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models we employed in our study exhibit varying degrees of interpretability. The linear regression model, in particular, is highly transparent. This model provides interpretable coefficients that directly relate to the input features, allowing for a clear understanding of how each feature contributes to the final prediction. This transparency is beneficial for identifying key interactions and understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the model's predictions.\n\nIn contrast, the neural network model is more of a black-box model. While it offers greater flexibility and expressiveness, the relationships between input features and outputs are less straightforward. The neural network learns complex, non-linear relationships from the data, making it difficult to interpret the specific contributions of individual features to the final prediction.\n\nThe elastic net linear model also falls into the category of interpretable models. It combines L1 and L2 regularization, which helps in feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. This results in a sparse model where only the most relevant features are retained, enhancing interpretability.\n\nOverall, while the linear regression and elastic net models offer clear insights into the feature importance and relationships, the neural network model provides more abstract and less interpretable predictions.",
  "model/output": "The model encompasses both classification and regression approaches. For the structure-based workflow, classification models were employed to distinguish between binders and non-binders using docked poses. These models were then used to re-rank and select docked poses of the ligands. The classification models included linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. The linear regression and logistic regression models achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on the balanced training set. The neural network model, with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy), achieved an AUC of 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset.\n\nFor the ligand-based approach, regression models were trained from binding affinity data using various chemical fingerprints. The models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with a perfect ranking of ligands producing an AUC of 1.0 and a random ranking resulting in an AUC of 0.5. The models used for predictions were trained on the entire training set. The linear regression model was selected for submission due to its faster evaluation and training times, more interpretable coefficients, and a wider range of prediction values compared to logistic regression.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for our models varied depending on the type of model and the dataset used. For the linear regression model, which was implemented using scikit-learn with default parameters, the training and evaluation process was relatively fast. This model achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on the balanced training set. The speed of linear models is one of the reasons we selected linear regression for our submission, as they are faster to evaluate and train compared to more complex models.\n\nThe neural network model, on the other hand, required more computational resources and time. This model was trained using the Caffe deep learning framework with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes. The training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. Despite the increased computational demand, the neural network model performed well, achieving a 10-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset.\n\nFor the test set, the provided SMILES of the ligands were converted into a single conformer with RDKit and then docked with smina. The docking process involved increased sampling to identify high-quality poses, which added to the overall execution time. For the HSP90 target, up to 9 distinct poses were generated for each receptor structure, resulting in a total of 21,893 poses. For MAP4K4, a 100ns molecular dynamics simulation was run using Amber14, and compounds were docked to ten diverse frames from the simulation, generating a total of 5,329 poses.\n\nIn summary, while the linear regression model was quicker to train and evaluate, the neural network model required more time due to its complexity and the number of iterations. The docking process for the test set also contributed significantly to the overall execution time, especially with the increased sampling and the generation of multiple poses for each ligand.",

  "evaluation/method": "For the evaluation of our models, we employed clustered cross-validation to ensure greater generalizability. This involved partitioning the DUD-E training set into multiple folds at a specified target granularity. By doing so, we ensured that the trained models were tested on entirely new targets, providing a robust measure of their performance.\n\nIn the context of classification, we assessed the models' ability to rank compounds accurately using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. An AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect ranking, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests random ranking. This metric was crucial for evaluating how well our models could distinguish between active and decoy compounds.\n\nFor internal validation, we used both linear regression and logistic regression models. Both models achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on a balanced dataset. Given that linear models are faster to evaluate and train, have more interpretable coefficients, and produce a wider range of prediction values, we selected a linear regression model for our submissions.\n\nAdditionally, we trained a neural network model with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy).

The binding site was defined using the cognate ligand of the receptor, and we increased the amount of sampling during docking to enhance the identification of high-quality poses. For the HSP90 target, we considered variations of the receptor structures with zero, one, or two waters within the binding site. For MAP4K4, we evaluated the flexibility of the binding site by considering different receptor structures.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation method involved a combination of clustered cross-validation, AUC assessment, and extensive docking simulations to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our models.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on metrics that assess the ability of our models to rank compounds correctly and predict binding affinities accurately. For classification tasks, such as virtual screening, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric ranges from 0.5 for random ranking to 1.0 for perfect ranking, providing a clear measure of how well our models discriminate between active and inactive compounds.\n\nFor pose prediction, we evaluated the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the predicted poses compared to the crystal structures. This metric helps us understand how accurately our models can predict the binding poses of ligands. We also considered the rank at which the lowest RMSD poses were found, which is crucial for understanding the practical utility of our scoring functions.\n\nIn addition to these, we reported Spearman correlation coefficients to evaluate the affinity prediction performance. This metric assesses the monotonic relationship between predicted and experimental binding affinities, providing insight into how well our models can predict the strength of ligand-receptor interactions.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating molecular docking and scoring functions. They provide a comprehensive view of our models' capabilities in virtual screening, pose prediction, and affinity prediction, making our evaluation representative and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of various methods using benchmark datasets. For the HSP90 ligands, we compared our structure-based and ligand-based machine learning approaches to publicly available methods like Vina. The performance was assessed using metrics such as Spearman correlation coefficients and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For instance, Vina achieved the highest AUC of 0.65 in virtual screening performance, but our structure-based methods trained using the balanced set and the ECFP6 ligand-based method performed similarly with AUCs of 0.63 or better.\n\nWe also evaluated simpler baselines, such as molecular weight, to understand the baseline performance. For the HSP90 ligands, the neural net model achieved a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.40, which was not substantially higher than the dataset’s correlation with molecular weight (0.34). This comparison helped us understand the relative performance of our more complex models against simpler baselines.\n\nFor the MAP4K4 dataset, we compared the performance of different methods in pose prediction and affinity prediction. The MAP4K4 dataset had fewer compounds with reported activities, making it challenging to compare methods meaningfully. However, we evaluated the affinity prediction performance by scoring the pose with the closest RMSD to the crystal ligand, which did not result in improved correlations.\n\nOverall, our evaluation included comparisons to both publicly available methods and simpler baselines, providing a thorough assessment of our approaches.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our evaluation, we have taken steps to ensure that our performance metrics are robust and reliable. For the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves, which assesses the ability of various methods to rank HSP90 ligand poses, we have included error bars indicating the 95% confidence interval. These intervals were determined through bootstrapping with replacement, using 1000 iterations. This approach provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with our AUC estimates.\n\nSimilarly, for the Spearman correlation coefficients used to evaluate the ranking of HSP90 and MAP4K4 ligands, we have also provided 95% confidence intervals through bootstrapping with replacement. This allows us to assess the statistical significance of the correlations and to compare the performance of different methods more meaningfully.\n\nIn terms of statistical significance, our results indicate that some methods achieve correlations that are statistically significant. For instance, the ECFP6 and RDKit 2D QSAR regression models show statistically significant correlations, although they do not outperform the structure-based methods. Additionally, the neural net model trained on the reduced set achieves the highest Spearman correlation coefficient for HSP90 ligands, but the correlation is not particularly high and is only marginally better than the dataset’s correlation with molecular weight.\n\nFor the MAP4K4 dataset, the small number of compounds with reported activities makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. However, the 95% confidence intervals provide insight into the variability and reliability of the results. Interestingly, scoring the pose with the closest RMSD to the crystal ligand did not result in improved correlations, suggesting that the scoring function's top-ranked pose is already a good predictor of affinity.\n\nOverall, while some methods show statistically significant performance, the differences between methods are often subtle. The inclusion of confidence intervals helps to contextualize these differences and to avoid overstating the superiority of any single method.",
