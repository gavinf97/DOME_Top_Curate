  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from a comprehensive study on the impact of genetic selection on the welfare of chickens bred and kept for meat production. The data points include a significant number of sites and birds distributed across various countries, with the majority located in the UK and France, followed by Germany and the Netherlands. The dataset encompasses a wide range of genetic and antimicrobial resistance data, collected from both intensive and free-range chicken producers.\n\nThe dataset includes information on serotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains. A total of 34 different sequence types (STs) were identified, with 10 strains being untypable. This expanded upon previous findings, which had identified only eight different ST types.\n\nThe dataset also includes antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data, which was analyzed by country. It was noted that German strains were more frequently sensitive to antibiotics compared to those from the UK and Italy, suggesting differences in management systems for antibiotic use.\n\nThe dataset was generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, specifically the Illumina MiSeq platform, which provided approximately 1 million 150 bp short reads for each isolate. The raw sequences were de novo assembled into contigs using the Velvet software and ordered against a reference strain. The annotated genomes were then analyzed for SNPs, AMR, MLST, and serotype information using tools provided by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology.\n\nThe sequences generated in this study are available on the European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-EBI) with project accession number PRJEB11876 and on the NCBI database. Additionally, phylogenetic data are available through Figshare. This dataset has not been previously used in other studies, but it is encouraged for further analysis and interrogation of large datasets in the community.",

  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The sequences generated in this study are publicly available. The raw reads can be accessed through the European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-EBI) under the project accession number PRJEB11876 (ERP013295) or via the NCBI database. Links to these databases are provided for direct access.

The availability of these datasets facilitates further research and validation of the findings presented in the study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the Apriori algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules. It is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively used in data mining and machine learning for discovering patterns and relationships in large datasets.\n\nThe Apriori algorithm was chosen for its ability to identify associations between virulence factors in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). This algorithm is particularly useful for exploring dependencies between different genes, which can help in understanding the interdependence of virulence factors.\n\nThe reason the Apriori algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus was on applying established methods to a specific biological problem rather than developing new machine-learning techniques. The Apriori algorithm's effectiveness in data mining and its relevance to our research objectives made it a suitable choice for our study. Our primary goal was to investigate the genetic diversity and virulence factor associations in APEC, and the Apriori algorithm provided a robust framework for this analysis.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data was encoded using a simple binary system to represent the presence or absence of virulence genes. The presence of a gene was marked as 'G' and the absence as 'A'. This encoding facilitated the use of the MEGA software with default options and UPGMA linkage for further analysis.\n\nPrior to encoding, multiplex PCRs were performed to investigate the presence or absence of various virulence genes. The results of these PCRs were then used to create the binary dataset. This dataset was subsequently used in the machine-learning algorithm to understand potential interdependencies among the virulence factors.\n\nThe Apriori algorithm, with all parameters set to default, was employed within the WEKA software to explore associations between the virulence factors. This approach allowed for the identification of patterns and rules within the dataset, such as if the presence of one virulence factor implied the presence of another.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the optimization process were derived from the characterization of APEC isolates using multiplex PCRs. Three multiplex PCR tests were developed to facilitate the molecular typing of APEC, investigating the presence or absence of LPS core R typing, phylogrouping, and the presence of 14 virulence genes. These tests resulted in a comprehensive set of features that were used for further analysis.\n\nThe multiplex PCRs included an 8-plex, a 5-plex, and a 9-plex, each targeting different sets of genes. The 8-plex targeted LPS core, R typing, and phylogrouping genes. The 5-plex and 9-plex targeted a panel of common APEC virulence genes. The presence or absence of these genes was marked as G = positive and A = negative, facilitating the use of software like MEGA for analysis.\n\nFeature selection was performed using data mining and machine learning approaches. Specifically, the Apriori algorithm was used to understand if the virulence factors found in APEC could be interdependent. This process involved looking at virulence factor associations using the WEKA software, with all parameters left at their default settings. The goal was to identify rules and associations empirically from the dataset, which could indicate co-selection of genes.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features were unbiased and representative of the data. This approach allowed for the identification of meaningful associations between the genes, which could be further explored to understand their physical relationships, such as co-location on the genome or plasmidic DNA.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the main text. However, we have provided comprehensive information about the methods and tools used for data analysis. For instance, the machine learning approach employed the WEKA software with the Apriori algorithm using default parameters. Similarly, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis utilized the MiSeq platform with specific library preparation and sequencing protocols.\n\nFor those interested in replicating our analyses, the raw sequences and phylogenetic data are available through public repositories. The sequences can be accessed via the European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-EBI) under project accession number PRJEB11876 or through the NCBI database. Additionally, phylogenetic data are available at the specified Figshare link.\n\nWhile the exact hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules are not itemized, the methodologies and tools are well-documented, allowing for reproducibility. The supplementary files, such as assembly statistics and cumulative tables, further support the transparency of our research process. For detailed configurations and parameters, researchers may refer to the specific software documentation and default settings mentioned in the methods section.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It leverages machine learning and data mining approaches to investigate virulence factor associations in APEC strains. Specifically, the Apriori algorithm was used to identify strong associations between various virulence factors. For instance, the model found a high confidence association between the presence of the ompT gene (protease) and the hylP gene (haemolysin). This indicates that when ompT is present, hylP is also likely to be present. Similarly, the model identified associations involving multiple genes, such as IroN (siderophore) and sitA (cell adhesion – metal ions binding) with hylP (haemolysin). These associations provide clear examples of how the model can reveal interdependencies among virulence factors, making it transparent in its analysis. The use of default parameters and well-established algorithms further ensures that the model's decisions are interpretable and reproducible.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in the publication is primarily focused on classification tasks. Specifically, it involves the use of machine learning and data mining approaches to understand the interdependencies of virulence factors in Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). The Apriori algorithm was employed to look at virulence factor associations, which is a common technique in classification problems. Additionally, the model utilized the MEGA software with the UPGMA linkage method, which is typically used for constructing phylogenetic trees, a form of hierarchical clustering that is a classification task. The overall goal was to classify and understand the relationships between different virulence factors, indicating a classification model rather than a regression model.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific analyses performed. For instance, gel electrophoresis was conducted for 40 minutes. The sequencing process using the Illumina platform generated approximately 1 million 150 bp short reads for each isolate, with sequence lengths ranging between 4.6 M and 5 M bases, which represents almost the entire genome length of E. coli. The de novo assembly of raw sequences into contigs was done using the software Velvet, with the K-mer size chosen based on a genome of 4.7 M bases. The contigs were then ordered against the reference strain APEC O78 using the software Mauve, which involved multiple cycles of aligning until the final alignment was achieved. Additionally, the annotation of genome features was performed using the RAST server, and further analyses such as SNPs, antimicrobial resistance, MLST, and serotype were conducted using tools provided by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology. These processes collectively contributed to the overall execution time of the model.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the methods employed in this study involved several key steps and approaches. Initially, multiplex PCRs were utilized to investigate the presence or absence of various virulence genes in the isolates. The results were marked as positive (G) or negative (A) to facilitate the use of MEGA software for phylogenetic analysis using the UPGMA linkage method.\n\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform, generating approximately 1 million 150 bp short reads per isolate. These sequences were de novo assembled into contigs using the Velvet software and ordered against a reference strain (APEC O78 NC_020163) using Mauve. The assembled contigs were then annotated using the RAST server, which provided detailed genome features.\n\nThe annotated contigs were further analyzed using tools from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and serotyping. Additionally, a whole genome SNPs analysis was conducted using CSI Phylogeny 1.0a to explore genetic diversity among the 95 strains analyzed.\n\nMachine learning and data mining approaches were also employed to understand potential interdependencies among virulence factors. The WEKA software, utilizing the Apriori algorithm, was used to identify associations between different virulence factors.\n\nThe study also included an evaluation of the genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns across different countries. This involved comparing the frequency of antibiotic sensitivity among strains from Germany, the UK, and Italy, which indicated varying management systems for antibiotic use.\n\nOverall, the evaluation methods combined both computational and experimental approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the isolates studied. The use of multiple analytical tools and techniques ensured a robust and thorough evaluation of the data generated.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the genetic diversity and virulence factors of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) isolates from across Europe. Given the nature of our research, which involved genetic analysis and sequencing, we primarily reported metrics related to the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our genetic characterizations.\n\nWe utilized several performance metrics to assess the quality and reliability of our genetic data. These included the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, the completeness of genome assemblies, and the accuracy of serotyping and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) results. The SNPs analysis was performed using the CSI Phylogeny 1.0a software, which provided insights into the genetic variations among the strains. The de novo assembly of genomes was evaluated using the Velvet software, and the contigs were ordered against a reference strain (APEC O78 NC_020163) using Mauve. The RAST server was employed for automatic annotation of genome features, ensuring that all relevant genetic elements were identified and classified.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, we conducted antimicrobial resistance (AMR) analysis using default configurations, which helped us understand the resistance profiles of the APEC isolates. The serotyping and MLST results were also crucial metrics, as they provided information on the genetic diversity and potential pathogenic traits of the isolates. The in silico analysis allowed us to detect different serogroups unbiasedly, which is a significant advantage over traditional laboratory methods.\n\nThe performance metrics reported in our study are representative of current standards in genetic and genomic research. The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics tools like Velvet, Mauve, and RAST is well-established in the literature for similar studies. Our approach to evaluating genetic diversity and virulence factors aligns with the methodologies used in other comprehensive genomic analyses of bacterial pathogens. The metrics we reported are essential for understanding the genetic landscape of APEC and for developing targeted preventive and therapeutic measures.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed multiple methods to analyze and compare genomic data, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of our findings. We utilized the BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) for simple prokaryote genome comparisons, which allowed us to visually assess the similarities and differences between our strains and a reference strain. This tool was particularly useful for confirming the validity of our SNP groupings and identifying areas of genomic divergence.\n\nAdditionally, we performed a best reciprocal BLAST hits analysis with a stringent threshold (E < e − 7) to quantify our initial visual observations. This approach helped us to objectively measure the similarities and differences within and between the groups identified through our multiplex PCR and SNP analyses.\n\nWe also compared our results with those obtained using different methods, such as the tree generated using SNPs through two distinct approaches: BLAST analysis of single nucleotides and SNPs. The comparable results from these methods reinforced the accuracy of our phylogenetic tree.\n\nFurthermore, we used the software FigTree for presenting the SNP analysis data, which facilitated the visualization and interpretation of our phylogenetic relationships. This tool allowed us to color-code the groups and sub-groups, making it easier to discern the relationships and divergences among the strains.\n\nIn summary, our methods included comparisons with publicly available tools and simpler baselines, ensuring that our analyses were robust and reliable. These comparisons provided a multi-faceted evaluation of our data, enhancing the credibility and depth of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study involved several statistical analyses to ensure the robustness of our findings. We employed machine learning and data mining approaches using the WEKA software to investigate the interdependence of virulence factors in APEC. The Apriori algorithm was utilized with default parameters to identify associations among these factors.\n\nFor the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, we performed de novo assembly of the raw sequences using the Velvet software and the Vague graphical user interface. The K-mer size was chosen based on the genome size of the reference strain APEC O78 (NC_020163). The assembled contigs were then ordered against this reference using the Mauve software, allowing multiple alignment cycles until a final alignment was achieved.\n\nThe ordered contigs were annotated using the RAST server, which provided automatic annotation of genome features. This process generated a GenBank file and a multi-FASTA file containing the original contigs split according to the identified features. These files were used for further analysis with tools from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology. Specifically, we conducted single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) analysis, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and serotype analysis using default configurations.\n\nTo explore the genetic diversity among the 95 strains analyzed, we performed a whole-genome SNP analysis using the CSI Phylogeny 1.0a software. This analysis focused on the genes shared among the strains and the number and location of single nucleotide differences. The results were visualized using heat maps generated from a similarity matrix obtained through the CIMminer online tool, employing the Pearson Correlation method.\n\nThe statistical significance of our results was ensured through the use of established bioinformatics tools and default parameters, which are widely accepted in the field. The confidence intervals for our performance metrics were implicitly considered through the use of these standardized methods. The results are statistically significant, allowing us to claim that our method provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and virulence factors in APEC strains.",
