  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consisted of approximately 23,000 protease (PR) gene sequences and 23,000 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences. These sequences were obtained from a publicly available and de-identified genotype-phenotype dataset from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database.\n\nA 5-fold cross-validation was employed, which means the dataset was randomly divided into five parts. Four of these parts were used for training the machine learning model, while the remaining part was used for testing. This process was repeated five times, with each part serving as the test set once. Consequently, the training set consisted of 18,400 PR and RT sequences, and the testing dataset consisted of 4,600 PR and RT sequences in each fold. This approach ensured that every sequence was used for both training and testing, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.",

The datasets are publicly available and de-identified, ensuring that no personal information is included. The data can be accessed through the Stanford HIV drug resistance database website.\n\nThe datasets were divided into training and testing sets. The training set consisted of 18,400 PR and RT sequences, while the testing dataset consisted of 4,600 PR and RT sequences.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study falls under the class of feature selection algorithms. Specifically, the techniques used include ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering. These methods are well-established in the field of machine learning and are used to determine the importance of each input feature, in this case, mutations, in predicting HIV drug resistance.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithms used are not new; they are established techniques in the field. ReliefF is a component for automatic variable selection in supervised learning tasks, capable of handling both continuous and discrete descriptors. FCBF filtering is a fast correlation-based filtering approach, while CFS filtering is another correlation-based filtering method. MODTree is a multivalued oblivious decision tree approach.\n\nThe reason these algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on applying these techniques to improve the prediction of HIV drug resistance, rather than developing new machine-learning algorithms. The study leverages existing machine-learning methods to enhance the effectiveness of the ANRS algorithm, which is a gold standard in interpreting HIV drug resistance. The primary contribution of this work is in the application and integration of these feature selection techniques to address a specific problem in the field of HIV research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a traditional meta-predictor. Instead, it incorporates machine learning techniques to enhance an existing algorithm, specifically the ANRS algorithm, which is used to predict HIV drug resistance.\n\nThe process involves several steps. Initially, publicly available genotype-phenotype datasets consisting of approximately 23,000 protease (PR) gene and 23,000 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences were obtained. These datasets were fed into the ANRS algorithm to obtain a resistance measure for each sequence, which was then compared to known resistance measures from laboratory tests to calculate the algorithm's accuracy.\n\nThe core of the enhancement lies in the development of an association matrix using feature selection algorithms. Techniques such as ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering were employed to determine the importance of each mutation in predicting HIV drug resistance. These feature selection methods help identify mutations that significantly contribute to drug resistance, which are not currently included in the ANRS algorithm.\n\nThe dataset was divided into training and testing sets using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. This ensures that the training data is independent of the testing data, maintaining the integrity of the model's evaluation. The training set consisted of 18,400 PR and RT sequences, while the testing set had 4,600 sequences. This process was repeated five times to calculate an average accuracy.\n\nThe top 10 mutation positions that contributed most to predicting HIV drug resistance were identified and added to the ANRS algorithm's rules. This new model was then applied to a separate testing dataset to analyze changes in its ability to predict HIV drug resistance. The results showed significant improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nIn summary, while the model utilizes outputs from machine learning algorithms to refine the ANRS algorithm, it does not operate as a meta-predictor in the traditional sense. The independence of the training data is ensured through the use of cross-validation, and the enhancement is achieved by integrating the findings from feature selection algorithms into the existing ANRS framework.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data used in this study consisted of approximately 23,000 protease (PR) gene and 23,000 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences, which were obtained from a publicly available and de-identified genotype-phenotype dataset. These sequences were fed into the ANRS algorithm to obtain a resistance measure for each sequence. The ANRS results were then compared to known resistance measures obtained from laboratory tests for each sequence, allowing for the calculation of the ANRS algorithm's accuracy.\n\nThe dataset was randomly divided into a training set consisting of 18,400 PR and RT sequences and a testing dataset consisting of 4,600 PR and RT sequences. This division was performed five times using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, ensuring that the model's predictive ability was thoroughly tested. The training component involved applying machine learning principles to create a mathematical mapping function, while the testing component evaluated the model's predictive accuracy on data with known outcomes.\n\nFeature selection techniques, including ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering, were employed to determine the importance of each mutation in predicting HIV drug resistance. These techniques helped identify the top 10 mutation positions for each antiretroviral (ARV) drug that contributed most significantly to predicting HIV drug resistance. The results from these filters were combined additively to create an association matrix for each drug. This matrix was then incorporated into the rules of the ANRS algorithm to enhance its predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the input parameters were determined through a feature selection process using machine learning techniques. We utilized datasets consisting of approximately 23,000 protease (PR) gene and 23,000 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences. These sequences were analyzed to identify the most significant mutations contributing to HIV drug resistance.\n\nThe feature selection algorithms employed included ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering.

The results from these filters were combined additively to identify the top 10 mutation positions for each antiretroviral (ARV) drug that had the most substantial contribution to predicting resistance.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model varied depending on the specific ARV drug being analyzed. For each drug, the top 10 mutation positions were selected, resulting in a different set of input parameters for each ARV. This approach ensured that the most relevant mutations were included in the model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on their statistical significance and contribution to the prediction of drug resistance. By focusing on the most important mutations, we aimed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the ANRS algorithm. The use of multiple feature selection techniques provided a robust framework for identifying these critical parameters.",

These sequences were obtained from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to determine the importance of each mutation in predicting HIV drug resistance. The techniques used for feature selection included ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering. These methods helped identify the most significant mutations contributing to drug resistance.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set consisting of 18,400 PR and RT sequences and a testing dataset consisting of 4,600 PR and RT sequences. This division was done five times as part of a 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the feature selection and model training. The results of the filters were combined additively, and the top 10 mutation positions for each antiretroviral (ARV) drug that had the biggest contribution to predicting HIV drug resistance were calculated. These top mutations formed the association matrix for each drug.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved machine learning techniques applied to a large dataset of genotype-phenotype sequences. The dataset consisted of approximately 23,000 protease (PR) gene and 23,000 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences, which is a substantial number of training points.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five parts, using four parts for training and one part for testing, and repeating this process five times with different partitions. This method ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, reducing the risk of over-fitting to any single subset.\n\nAdditionally, feature selection techniques such as ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering were used. These methods help in identifying the most relevant features (mutations) that contribute to predicting HIV drug resistance, thereby reducing the number of parameters and mitigating over-fitting.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the study utilized multiple feature selection algorithms to ensure that important mutations were not overlooked. The results of these filters were combined additively to create an association matrix for each drug, which was then incorporated into the ANRS algorithm. This approach helped in capturing a comprehensive set of relevant features, ensuring that the model was not too simplistic.\n\nThe effectiveness of the model was further validated by applying it to a separate testing dataset that was not used in the training process. The changes in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the prediction of HIV drug resistance. This validation step ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, indicating that under-fitting was effectively avoided.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our machine learning models. One of the primary methods used was feature selection, which helps in identifying the most relevant mutations contributing to HIV drug resistance. By focusing on the top 10 mutation positions for each antiretroviral (ARV) drug, we reduced the complexity of the model and minimized the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a 5-fold cross-validation approach. This involved randomly dividing the dataset into training and testing sets multiple times, ensuring that the model's performance was evaluated on different subsets of the data. This technique helps in assessing the model's generalization ability and reduces the likelihood of overfitting to a specific dataset.\n\nWe also employed various filtering techniques such as ReliefF, MODTree, FCBF, and CFS. These methods helped in selecting the most informative features, further enhancing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. By combining the results of these filters additively, we created an association matrix that captured the most significant mutations for each ARV drug.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques played a crucial role in improving the predictive accuracy and reliability of the ANRS algorithm, ensuring that it could effectively predict HIV drug resistance across different datasets.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black box. It incorporates a transparent approach by utilizing feature selection algorithms to identify specific mutations that contribute to HIV drug resistance. These algorithms, such as ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering, help determine the importance of each mutation in predicting resistance.\n\nFor instance, mutations like P63, P57, P82, and P69 were identified as major contributors to predicting HIV drug resistance for protease ARV drugs. Similarly, P30, P35, P142, and P83 were found to be important for RT ARV drugs. These mutations, which were not initially part of the ANRS algorithm, were added to the existing rules to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nThe association matrix created from these feature selection techniques provides a clear and interpretable way to understand how specific mutations influence drug resistance. By combining the top 10 mutation positions for each ARV drug, the model offers a transparent view of the factors contributing to resistance predictions. This transparency allows for a better understanding of the model's decision-making process and facilitates improvements in predicting HIV drug resistance.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict HIV drug resistance, which is a categorical outcome (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) rather than a continuous value. The model uses machine learning techniques, specifically feature selection algorithms, to identify important mutations that contribute to drug resistance. These mutations are then incorporated into the ANRS algorithm to improve its predictive accuracy. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), which are all relevant to classification tasks. The results show significant improvements in these metrics when the machine learning-derived mutations are added to the ANRS algorithm, indicating the effectiveness of the classification model in predicting HIV drug resistance.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive approach to assess the effectiveness of the improved ANRS algorithm. Initially, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed, where the dataset was randomly divided into training and testing sets. This process was repeated five times, and the average accuracy was calculated to ensure robustness. The training set consisted of 18,400 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences, while the testing set had 4,600 sequences.\n\nFeature selection techniques, including ReliefF, MODTree filtering, FCBF filtering, and CFS filtering, were employed to determine the importance of each mutation in predicting HIV drug resistance. These techniques were applied separately to PR and RT sequences, and the results were combined to create an association matrix for each drug. This matrix was then integrated into the ANRS algorithm's rules.\n\nThe enhanced model was subsequently evaluated on a separate testing dataset that had not been used in the training process. The changes in the algorithm's ability to predict HIV drug resistance were analyzed by calculating the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Statistical tests, such as t-tests, were conducted to determine if the improvements were statistically significant. The results showed substantial enhancements in the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for both PR and RT drugs, indicating a statistically significant improvement in the algorithm's performance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of the improved ANRS algorithm, several key performance metrics were reported to assess the effectiveness of incorporating machine learning-derived mutations. The primary metrics used were accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These metrics were chosen to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's predictive capabilities.\n\nAccuracy was measured to determine the overall correctness of the predictions made by the algorithm. This metric is crucial as it provides a general sense of how well the algorithm performs across all predictions.\n\nPPV, also known as precision, indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the algorithm. This metric is particularly important in the context of HIV drug resistance prediction, as it reflects the reliability of the algorithm in identifying true resistance cases.\n\nNPV, on the other hand, represents the proportion of true negative predictions among all negative predictions. This metric is essential for understanding the algorithm's ability to correctly identify sequences that are susceptible to the drugs, which is vital for avoiding unnecessary treatment changes.\n\nThe reported improvements in these metrics were statistically significant, as evidenced by the p-values obtained from t-tests. For instance, the PPV improved by 27% and the NPV by 16% for protease ARV drugs, indicating a substantial enhancement in the algorithm's predictive power.\n\nAdditionally, the study reported the sensitivity and specificity of the predictions, which further validated the effectiveness of the improved algorithm. Sensitivity measures the algorithm's ability to correctly identify resistant sequences, while specificity measures its ability to correctly identify susceptible sequences.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating predictive models in healthcare, particularly in the context of HIV drug resistance. The inclusion of both PPV and NPV, along with accuracy, provides a balanced view of the algorithm's performance, addressing both the true positive and true negative rates. This comprehensive approach ensures that the improvements reported are robust and reliable, making the findings relevant and applicable to real-world clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on improving the existing ANRS algorithm using machine learning techniques. It did not involve a direct comparison to other publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Instead, the research concentrated on enhancing the ANRS algorithm's predictive accuracy by incorporating an association matrix derived from feature selection algorithms. The effectiveness of this improved model was evaluated by comparing its performance to the original ANRS algorithm using a separate testing dataset. The study demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for predicting HIV drug resistance across various antiretroviral drugs.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the machine learning approach to improve the ANRS algorithm for predicting HIV drug resistance included several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals. For instance, the overall accuracy improvement for protease inhibitor (PI) sequences was reported as 88% ± 7.1%, and for reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences, it was 69% ± 10.9%. These intervals provide a measure of the reliability of the reported improvements.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using t-tests. The results indicated that the improvements were not due to random chance, with p-values less than 0.001 for PI sequences and 0.004 for RT sequences. This suggests that the observed enhancements in prediction accuracy are statistically significant.\n\nAdditionally, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated. The PPV improved by 27% and the NPV by 16% when the machine learning mutations were incorporated into the ANRS algorithm. A Z-score greater than 1.98 was obtained, indicating a statistically significant difference when adding the association matrix.\n\nOverall, the evaluation demonstrates that the machine learning approach significantly improves the prediction ability of the ANRS algorithm, with robust statistical support for the observed enhancements.",
