  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from Pfam, a comprehensive collection of protein families. Pfam contains approximately 16,000 protein families, which vary significantly in size, ranging from a few tens to hundreds of thousands of effective sequences. Notably, about half of these families, roughly 7,500, do not have a representative structure. These families are particularly interesting because they are too small for traditional maximum entropy contact prediction methods but may be within reach for advanced machine learning techniques combined with direct coupling analysis.\n\nIn this work, we applied the PconsFold2 pipeline to 6,379 Pfam families of unknown structure. This effort resulted in the prediction of structures for up to 558 Pfam families with an estimated 90% specificity. Out of these, 415 families had not been reported before. This dataset represents a significant contribution to the field, as it leverages state-of-the-art contact prediction methods to model protein structures that were previously inaccessible. The models and datasets generated are freely available, facilitating further research and validation by the scientific community.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into a test set and a set of domains with unknown structure. The test dataset was generated from 626 Pfam domains that were randomly selected from 6925 domains with known structure that are longer than 50 residues. This ensures that the test set is independent of the set used for training and evaluation.\n\nTo enforce independence, all Pfam domains that can be found in the pdbmap file from Pfam release 29.0 and those shorter than 50 residues were excluded from the set of domains with unknown structure. This results in a set of 7537 Pfam domains with unknown structure. For each of these sequences, the highest ranked sequence in the HHblits alignment against uniref20 was defined as the reference sequence of the family.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field. There are 16,295 protein domain families in Pfam 29.0, out of which 7733 domains have a known structure. This provides a large and diverse set of data for training and testing models. The use of HHblits and Jackhmmer for generating alignments ensures that the datasets are comprehensive and cover a wide range of protein families. The focus on domains longer than 50 residues aligns with common practices in the field, ensuring that the datasets are relevant and useful for developing and evaluating contact prediction methods.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in our pipeline is not a standalone machine-learning algorithm but rather a combination of direct coupling analysis (DCA) and advanced machine learning methods. This approach is designed to predict accurate contact maps for protein families, even those with fewer sequences.\n\nThe machine-learning component is not entirely new; it builds upon existing methods that have been refined and combined with DCA to improve contact prediction accuracy. The specific machine-learning techniques used are not detailed in isolation, as the focus is on their application within the context of protein structure prediction.\n\nThe reason this work was published in a bioinformatics journal rather than a machine-learning journal is that the primary contribution is in the field of protein structure prediction and model quality assessment. The machine-learning aspects are secondary to the biological application and the improvements they bring to protein modeling. The pipeline, PconsFold2, integrates these machine-learning methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of protein structure predictions, which is the main novelty presented in this work.",
  "optimization/meta": "The PconsFold2 pipeline incorporates a meta-predictor approach to enhance the reliability of protein structure predictions. This meta-predictor, named PcombC, integrates multiple quality assessment methods to evaluate the accuracy of predicted protein models. Specifically, PcombC combines the scores from three different methods: the Pcons consensus method, ProQ3D, and CNS-contact energy.\n\nThe Pcons consensus method assesses the quality of a protein model by comparing it against other models in a set, providing a consensus score. ProQ3D uses deep learning to evaluate the quality of a single model. CNS-contact energy measures how well the predicted model satisfies the predicted contacts.\n\nPcombC is designed as a linear combination of these three methods, optimized to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate models. This combination leverages the strengths of each individual method, resulting in a more robust and reliable assessment of model quality.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is implied that the methods constituting PcombC are trained on independent datasets. This independence is crucial for ensuring that the meta-predictor's performance is not biased by overlapping data, thereby enhancing its generalizability and reliability. However, specific details about the training data independence are not explicitly stated, but it is a standard practice in developing meta-predictors to ensure such independence.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, multiple sequence alignments were generated for each protein family. These alignments were created using different methods and E-value cutoffs to capture a diverse range of sequence information. The alignments were then used to predict contact maps using the PconsC3 method. These contact maps represent the predicted interactions between residues in the protein sequence.\n\nFor each alignment, a set of top-ranked contacts was selected based on a threshold of 2.5 times the length of the sequence. This threshold was determined to be optimal for generating accurate models. The contact maps were then used as input for the CONFOLD folding algorithm, which generates protein structures. The CONFOLD pipeline was run in its first stage to keep the runtime low, producing 50 models per alignment, resulting in a pool of 200 models per protein family.\n\nThe models generated by CONFOLD were ranked using a combination of scores, including the CNS contact energy, ProQ3D, Pcons, and a linear combination of these scores called PcombC. The PcombC score was developed to improve the ranking of models by optimizing the area under the ROC curve for determining model correctness. This score combines the strengths of individual scoring methods to provide a more reliable assessment of model quality.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that the data was in a suitable format for the machine-learning algorithm, allowing for accurate contact predictions and reliable model ranking. The use of multiple alignments and a combination of scoring methods enhanced the robustness and accuracy of the predicted protein structures.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, a grid-search was employed to determine the coefficients for the combined model quality estimator, PcombC. This estimator is a linear combination of the scores from ProQ3D, Pcons, and PPV. The grid-search was conducted over a range of values from 0 to 1 with a step size of 0.1, resulting in a grid of 10 x 10 x 10, which means 1000 different combinations of coefficients were evaluated. The coefficients were then normalized to ensure the score remained within the same scale as the input scores. The final coefficients for PcombC are 0.3 for Pcons, 0.6 for ProQ3D, and 1.0 for PPV. These coefficients were selected to optimize the area under the ROC-curve for determining whether a model is correct or not, using a TM-score threshold of 0.5.",
  "optimization/features": "The optimization process involves several input features derived from the contact predictions and model quality assessments. Specifically, the features used include the CNS contact energy, ProQ3D scores, Pcons scores, and PPV. These features are combined into a linear model called PcombC, which is optimized using a grid-search on a 10 x 10 x 10 grid with values ranging from 0 to 1 and a step size of 0.1. The coefficients of PcombC are normalized to ensure the score remains within the same scale as the input scores.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by choosing the most relevant scores from the available methods. The selection of features was based on their performance in previous studies and their ability to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate models. The optimization of the coefficients for PcombC was done using a grid-search, which effectively fine-tunes the contribution of each feature to the final score. This process ensures that the most informative features are given appropriate weight in the model quality assessment. The grid-search was conducted on a separate dataset to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the selected features and their coefficients are generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our predictions. One key aspect was the use of a combination of alignment methods and E-value thresholds. By generating multiple alignments with varying parameters, we aimed to capture a broader range of potential contact maps, reducing the risk of overfitting to a single alignment. This approach was validated by observing that the combined use of all alignments slightly improved the quality of both the top-ranked and best possible models.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated model quality assessment methods to filter out unreliable predictions. These methods, including PcombC, CNS-contact, ProQ3D, and Pcons, were shown to significantly improve the detection of correct models compared to using individual methods alone. The combined quality assessment approach provided a more sensitive and reliable way to evaluate model accuracy, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nMoreover, we set stringent score cutoffs based on false positive rates (FPR) from ROC analysis. By applying these cutoffs, we ensured that only models with a high likelihood of accuracy were considered, thereby reducing the chances of overfitting to noisy or incorrect data. This rigorous evaluation process was crucial in identifying reliable models for protein families without known structures.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the datasets and models generated for the 558 Pfam families are available at http://c3.pcons.net/. All programs used in the study are freely available, which implies that the methods and tools can be accessed and utilized by others. The specific details about the hyper-parameters, optimization schedules, and model files might be part of the supplementary materials or the codebase associated with the programs, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, while the general approach and results are accessible, the specific configurations and parameters might require further inquiry into the supplementary materials or direct contact with the authors.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model quality estimation methods used in our pipeline, particularly the combined method PcombC, offer a significant advantage in terms of interpretability. Unlike black-box models, these methods provide a clear and interpretable score that reflects the absolute model quality. This enables confident statements about the likelihood of a predicted model being correct.\n\nPcombC, for instance, integrates scores from multiple quality assessment tools, including Pcons, ProQ3D, and CNS-contact energy. This combination allows for a more nuanced evaluation of model quality. The scores from these individual methods are linearly combined in a way that has been optimized to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate models. This approach not only helps in selecting the best models from a set of predictions but also in assessing how much these models can be trusted.\n\nThe interpretability of these scores is further supported by their strong correlation with the TM-score, a widely accepted metric for evaluating protein model quality. For example, the Pearson correlation is highest for PcombC, followed by Pcons and ProQ3D, indicating that these methods provide reliable indicators of model accuracy. This transparency is crucial for researchers who need to understand the confidence levels associated with their predictions, especially when dealing with protein families of unknown structure.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is primarily focused on protein structure prediction, which is a regression task in the context of predicting continuous values such as TM-scores that indicate the quality of the predicted protein models. The pipeline, PconsFold2, uses contact predictions from PconsC3 and the CONFOLD folding algorithm to generate protein structures. Model quality assessment methods, including PcombC, Pcons, ProQ3D, and CNS-contact energy, are employed to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. These methods help in ranking and selecting the top models based on their predicted scores, which are then used to estimate the confidence in the correctness of the predicted models. The output of the model includes predicted structures for protein families, along with quality scores that indicate the reliability of these predictions. The goal is to identify models that can be trusted, with a focus on achieving high specificity in the predictions. The pipeline has been applied to a large set of Pfam families with unknown structures, resulting in predicted structures for a significant number of these families. The quality assessment tools play a crucial role in ensuring that the predicted models are accurate and reliable.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the folding step was measured on a single core of an Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 processor. On average, it took around 30 seconds to generate one model. The time varied depending on the length of the protein sequence, with a minimum of 4 seconds per model for the shortest family (50 residues) and a maximum of 245 seconds for the longest family (524 residues).",
  "model/availability": "The PconsFold2 pipeline, which utilizes contact predictions from PconsC3 and the CONFOLD folding algorithm, is freely available. All programs used in the pipeline can be accessed without any cost. The datasets, as well as models of all the 558 Pfam families, are available at http://c3.pcons.net/. This resource provides a comprehensive set of tools and data for researchers interested in protein structure prediction and model quality assessment. The availability of these resources ensures that the methods described can be replicated and further developed by the scientific community.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the PconsFold2 pipeline involved several steps to ensure its effectiveness in predicting protein structures. Initially, the pipeline was tested on a dataset of 626 Pfam domains with known structures, which were randomly selected from a larger set of domains. This test dataset allowed for the assessment of the pipeline's performance in generating accurate models.\n\nThe evaluation focused on the quality of the predicted models, measured by the TM-score, which indicates the similarity between the predicted and native structures. The average TM-score of the best models generated by the pipeline was found to improve with an increasing number of models, up to a point where generating 50 models per contact map provided a good balance between model quality and computational efficiency.\n\nTo further validate the pipeline, it was applied to a set of 6379 Pfam families without known structures. The goal was to predict the structures of these families with a high degree of confidence. The evaluation used score cutoffs at false positive rates (FPR) of 0.01 and 0.1 to estimate the number of Pfam families that could be accurately predicted. At an FPR of 0.01, models for 114 Pfam families were predicted to be accurate. This number increased to 558 families when allowing for an FPR of 0.1. Notably, more than 74% of these families did not overlap with other large-scale structure prediction studies, indicating that the approach is complementary to existing methods.\n\nThe evaluation also compared the predicted models with those from other studies, such as the Baker group. In cases where models overlapped, the TM-align score was used to assess the similarity between the models. The results showed that in 74% of the cases, the models had a TM-align score of 0.50 or higher, suggesting that they represented the same fold. In some instances, differences were observed, such as the PconsFold2 models being mirror images of the Baker models.\n\nOverall, the evaluation demonstrated that the PconsFold2 pipeline, which combines contact prediction, structure generation, and model quality assessment, significantly improves the reliability and sensitivity of protein structure prediction. The use of a combined model quality estimator, PcombC, further enhanced the ability to identify accurate models.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the quality of our protein structure predictions. One of the primary metrics we reported is the TM-score, which measures the similarity between the predicted model and the native structure. A TM-score of 0.5 or higher indicates a model that is of correct topology.\n\nWe also evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the contact maps, which indicates the accuracy of the predicted contacts in the protein structure. A higher PPV suggests better contact prediction accuracy.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of our model quality assessment methods, we used Pearson correlation coefficients. These coefficients measure the linear relationship between the predicted scores and the actual TM-scores. Higher correlation values indicate better performance in predicting model quality.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized ROC curves and false positive rates (FPR) to evaluate how well our methods classify models as correct or incorrect. This is particularly important when there is no known structure available for comparison. The ROC analysis helps in understanding the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at various threshold settings.\n\nWe compared the performance of different quality assessment tools, including PcombC, Pcons, ProQ3D, and CNS-contact energy. PcombC, a combined method, showed the highest Pearson correlation with TM-score, followed by Pcons and ProQ3D. While the average TM-score of the top-ranked models was similar across all methods, PcombC demonstrated superior ability in identifying correct models, especially at lower false positive rates.\n\nOverall, our set of metrics is representative of standard practices in the field of protein structure prediction and quality assessment. We aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation that includes both contact prediction accuracy and model quality estimation, ensuring that our methods are robust and reliable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our methods, we performed a comprehensive comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. We assessed the performance of various quality assessment tools, including Pcons, ProQ3D, and CNS-contact, to evaluate model quality. Additionally, we developed a combined model quality estimator, PcombC, which integrates the scores from these three methods. This combined approach was optimized to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate models, providing a more reliable prediction of model accuracy.\n\nWe also compared our methods to simpler baselines, such as using the number of effective sequences or the PconsC3 scores alone. The results clearly indicated that our combined method, PcombC, outperformed these individual methods. For instance, at a false positive rate (FPR) of 10%, PcombC identified 152 models compared to 106–136 models identified by the individual methods. At a more stringent FPR of 1%, PcombC identified 29% of the models, whereas the individual methods identified only 12–15%.\n\nFurthermore, we applied our pipeline to a set of Pfam domains without known structures, resulting in predicted structures for 6379 Pfam families, which constitutes 85% of all Pfam domains with unknown structures. We set score cutoffs at FPRs of 0.01 and 0.1 based on ROC analysis and used these cutoffs to estimate the number of Pfam families that could be accurately predicted. At an FPR of 0.01, models for 114 Pfam families were predicted to be accurate, and this number increased to 558 families at an FPR of 0.1. Notably, more than 74% of these families did not overlap with other large-scale structure prediction studies, indicating the complementary nature of our approach.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation involved a thorough comparison with both publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating the superior performance of our combined model quality assessment approach.",
