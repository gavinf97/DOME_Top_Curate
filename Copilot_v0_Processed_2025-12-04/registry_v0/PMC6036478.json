  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Specifically, we downloaded the gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients under the accession number GSE39582. The expression levels were measured using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which includes 54,675 probes corresponding to 20,502 genes. The probes corresponding to the same gene were averaged to ensure accurate representation. The gene expression data underwent quantile normalization to standardize the data across samples.\n\nWithin this dataset, there were 369 CIN+ and 112 CIN- patients, 93 CIMP+ and 420 CIMP- patients, and 77 dMMR and 459 pMMR patients. For each analysis, patients with missing status information were excluded to ensure the integrity of the data. For example, when comparing CIN+ and CIN- patients, only the 369 CIN+ and 112 CIN- patients were considered, excluding the 104 patients without CIN information.\n\nThis dataset has been utilized in previous research and by the community, making it a reliable source for our study on the relationship between CIN, CIMP, and MMR in colorectal cancer. The comprehensive nature of the dataset allows for robust analysis and the identification of biomarker genes associated with these conditions.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consists of gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients. These patients were annotated with chromosome instability (CIN), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and mismatch repair (MMR) status.\n\nFor the CIN-associated gene selection, the dataset included 369 CIN+ and 112 CIN- patients. Patients without CIN information were excluded from this analysis.\n\nFor the CIMP-associated gene selection, the dataset included 93 CIMP+ and 420 CIMP- patients. Patients without CIMP information were excluded from this analysis.\n\nFor the MMR-associated gene selection, the dataset included 77 dMMR and 459 pMMR patients. Patients without MMR information were excluded from this analysis.\n\nThe gene expression levels were measured using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which includes 54,675 probes corresponding to 20,502 genes. The probes corresponding to the same gene were averaged, and the gene expression data was preprocessed with quantile normalization.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The gene expression profiles used in this study were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, specifically under the accession number GSE39582. This dataset is publicly available and includes expression levels measured with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which comprises 54,675 probes corresponding to 20,502 genes. The data was preprocessed using quantile normalization to ensure consistency.\n\nThe dataset includes information for 585 colorectal cancer patients, with annotations for chromosome instability (CIN), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and mismatch repair (MMR) status. For each analysis, patients with missing status information were excluded to maintain data integrity. For instance, when comparing CIN+ and CIN- patients, only those with complete CIN status information were considered.\n\nThe data splits used in the study were determined by the availability of complete status information for each patient. This approach ensures that the analyses are based on reliable and complete datasets, enhancing the robustness of the findings. The use of public datasets like GEO ensures that the data is accessible to other researchers, promoting reproducibility and further validation of the results.\n\nThe data is available under the terms and conditions specified by the GEO database, which typically include proper citation and acknowledgment of the original source. Researchers interested in accessing the data can do so by visiting the GEO website and following the guidelines for data usage and citation. This open access policy facilitates collaboration and the advancement of scientific research in the field of colorectal cancer.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is based on machine learning techniques, specifically the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This is a well-established algorithm class in the field of machine learning, known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used is not new; it has been widely utilized in various bioinformatics applications. The choice of SVM is justified by its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data, which is common in gene expression profiles. The implementation of SVM in this study is facilitated by the R package e1071, which provides a straightforward interface for building and evaluating SVM classifiers.\n\nThe decision to use SVM in this context is driven by the need for a reliable and efficient classification method to handle the imbalanced dataset of colorectal cancer patients. The performance of the SVM classifier is evaluated using metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its predictive power.\n\nGiven that SVM is a mature and widely accepted algorithm, there was no necessity to publish the optimization algorithm in a machine-learning journal. The focus of this study is on the application of SVM to identify biomarkers associated with chromosomal instability (CIN), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and mismatch repair (MMR) in colorectal cancer, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The meta-predictor described in this work does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on the incremental feature selection (IFS) method to determine the optimal number of genes for building a classifier with high performance and low complexity. The IFS method involves constructing multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, each using a different number of top-ranked genes from the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) list. The performance of these classifiers is evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), and metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient are calculated to assess their effectiveness.\n\nThe meta-predictor is not a combination of different machine-learning methods in the traditional sense of a meta-predictor. Rather, it is a systematic approach to feature selection and model evaluation. The SVM classifiers are built and evaluated independently, with the goal of identifying the most informative genes for predicting the status of CIN, CIMP, and MMR in colorectal cancer patients.\n\nRegarding the independence of the training data, the LOOCV method ensures that each sample is used once as a validation set while the remaining samples form the training set. This approach helps to mitigate overfitting and provides a robust estimate of the classifier's performance. The independence of the training data is maintained throughout the process, as each sample is evaluated in isolation from the others during the validation phase.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE39582. The expression levels were measured using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which includes 54,675 probes corresponding to 20,502 genes. To preprocess the data, the probes corresponding to the same gene were averaged. Quantile normalization was applied to the gene expression data to ensure consistency across samples.\n\nFor the analysis, patients with missing status information were excluded. For instance, when comparing CIN+ and CIN- patients, only the 369 CIN+ and 112 CIN- patients were considered, while the 104 patients without CIN information were excluded. This preprocessing step ensured that the dataset was clean and ready for further analysis.\n\nThe minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) method was used to rank genes based on their relevance to the CIN status and their redundancy with already selected genes. This method, grounded in information theory, has been widely utilized in bioinformatics. The top 500 genes from the mRMR ranking were selected for further analysis.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of genes for building a classifier, the incremental feature selection (IFS) method was employed. This involved constructing 500 support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, each using a different number of top genes from the mRMR list. The performance of each classifier was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The metrics used to assess performance included Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Due to the imbalance in the sizes of positive (CIN+) and negative (CIN-) samples, MCC, which considers both Sn and Sp, was chosen as the primary measurement.\n\nThe IFS curve, plotting the number of top genes against the LOOCV MCCs, helped in deciding the number of genes to use for building a classifier with high performance and low complexity. The peak or change point of the IFS curve was typically selected as the optimal number of genes. For the CIN-associated genes, 34 genes were chosen based on this method, achieving a LOOCV MCC of 0.648. These genes were able to effectively cluster CIN+ and CIN- patients into their respective groups.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific analysis being conducted. For the chromosome instability (CIN) analysis, 34 genes were selected as parameters. These genes were chosen based on their performance in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) using the incremental feature selection (IFS) method, which considered both sensitivity and specificity. The selection process involved ranking genes using the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) method and then evaluating different numbers of top genes to determine the optimal set that maximized the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nFor the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) analysis, 19 genes were selected as parameters. Similarly, for the mismatch repair (MMR) analysis, 18 genes were chosen. In each case, the selection of the number of genes was guided by the IFS curve, which plotted the number of top genes against the LOOCV MCC. The peak or change point of the IFS curve was used to decide the optimal number of genes to include in the model, ensuring a balance between performance and complexity.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized gene expression profiles from 585 colorectal cancer patients to identify biomarker genes associated with CIN, CIMP, and MMR statuses. For each status, we employed the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) method to rank genes based on their relevance to the respective status and their redundancy among each other. This process resulted in a ranked list of genes for each status.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of genes to use as input features for our classifiers, we applied the incremental feature selection (IFS) method. This involved constructing multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, each using a different number of top-ranked genes from the mRMR list. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), with metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) being calculated.\n\nFor CIN-associated genes, the top 34 genes were selected based on the IFS curve, resulting in a classifier with LOOCV Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and MCC of 0.932, 0.696, 0.877, and 0.648, respectively. For CIMP-associated genes, the top 19 genes were chosen, achieving a classifier with LOOCV Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and MCC of 0.710, 0.976, 0.928, and 0.744, respectively. For MMR-associated genes, the top 18 genes were selected, leading to a classifier with LOOCV Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and MCC of 0.922, 0.985, 0.976, and 0.902, respectively.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the mRMR method, which ensures that the selected features are relevant to the target status while minimizing redundancy. The IFS method further refined the selection by identifying the optimal number of features that maximize classifier performance. Both mRMR and IFS were conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the feature selection process did not introduce any bias from the test set.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) method followed by incremental feature selection (IFS) to identify biomarker genes associated with CIN, CIMP, and MMR in colorectal cancer. The mRMR method ranks genes based on their relevance to the target condition and their redundancy with already selected genes, ensuring that the selected genes are both informative and diverse.\n\nThe IFS method was then used to determine the optimal number of top-ranked genes from the mRMR list to build a classifier. We constructed 500 support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, each time using an increasing number of top genes from the mRMR list. The performance of each classifier was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), and metrics such as Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) were calculated.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the imbalance in the sizes of positive and negative samples, we chose MCC as the major measurement. MCC considers both Sn and Sp, providing a balanced evaluation of the classifier's performance. The IFS curve, which plots the number of top genes against the LOOCV MCCs, helped us identify the point where adding more genes did not significantly improve performance, thus preventing overfitting.\n\nConversely, to ensure that our model was not underfitting, we systematically increased the number of genes in the classifier and monitored the performance metrics. The peak or change point of the IFS curve indicated the optimal number of genes that provided a good balance between model complexity and performance. This approach ensured that our model was neither too simple (underfitting) nor too complex (overfitting).\n\nAdditionally, we used a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network (STRING network) with high-confidence interactions to further analyze the downstream effects of the identified genes. This network-based approach helped us pinpoint the regions affected by the biomarker genes and investigate commonly regulated genes, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular cross-talk among CIN, CIMP, and MMR.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classifiers. One of the key methods used was leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). This technique involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining observations as the training data. This process is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation data. LOOCV provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the classifier's performance on independent data, helping to mitigate overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the incremental feature selection (IFS) method to determine the optimal number of genes to include in our classifiers. The IFS method constructs multiple classifiers using an increasing number of top-ranked genes from the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) list. The performance of each classifier is evaluated using LOOCV, and the number of genes that yields the highest Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is selected. This approach helps to identify the most relevant features while avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant or redundant genes that could lead to overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we considered the imbalance in the sizes of positive and negative samples in our study. To address this, we chose MCC as the primary measurement for evaluating the classifiers' performance. MCC takes into account both sensitivity and specificity, providing a more balanced evaluation metric for imbalanced datasets. This helps to ensure that the classifiers are not biased towards the majority class, further reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, we implemented LOOCV, IFS, and MCC as key techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization performance of our classifiers. These methods collectively contribute to the robustness and reliability of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, we detailed the use of the mRMR method for gene ranking and the IFS method for selecting the optimal number of genes. The mRMR method was applied using a C/C++ version software, and the IFS method involved constructing support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with default parameters from the R package e1071. The restart probability for the random walk with restart (RWR) method was set to 0.7, as suggested by previous studies.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methods and parameters used for gene selection and classification are thoroughly described, allowing for reproducibility. The gene expression profiles used in the study were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE39582. The data preprocessing steps, including quantile normalization, are also detailed.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the tools and datasets used, the mRMR software is available for download from the specified URL, and the R package e1071 is open-source and can be accessed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The GEO dataset is publicly available, and its use is governed by the terms and conditions specified by the GEO database.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox but rather a transparent and interpretable approach. The methodology used, which combines minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS), ensures that the selected genes are both relevant to the phenotype of interest and non-redundant. This transparency is further enhanced by the use of support vector machines (SVMs) for classification, which, although not inherently interpretable, are applied in a manner that allows for clear evaluation of their performance through metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nThe mRMR method ranks genes based on their relevance to the phenotype (e.g., CIN, CIMP, MMR status) and their redundancy with already selected genes. This ranking provides a clear and interpretable list of genes that are most informative for distinguishing between different phenotypes. The IFS method then builds classifiers using an increasing number of top-ranked genes and evaluates their performance. The peak of the IFS curve indicates the optimal number of genes for building a classifier with high performance and low complexity. For example, in the case of CIN-associated genes, the top 34 genes were selected based on the IFS curve, and their performance metrics were clearly reported.\n\nAdditionally, the use of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) ensures that the model's performance is rigorously evaluated and that the selected genes are robust and generalizable. The results are presented in a manner that allows for easy interpretation, such as the clustering of patients based on gene expression profiles and the identification of genes that are highly expressed in specific phenotypes.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the use of interpretable feature selection methods, clear performance evaluation metrics, and rigorous validation techniques. This ensures that the results are not only scientifically sound but also easily understandable and reproducible.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed to identify genes associated with different colorectal cancer phenotypes, such as chromosome instability (CIN), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and mismatch repair (MMR). The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using metrics such as Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). The goal was to determine the optimal number of genes to use for building classifiers with high performance and low complexity. The incremental feature selection (IFS) method was used to select the top genes from a ranked list obtained through the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) method. This approach allowed for the identification of key genes that could effectively distinguish between different patient groups based on their gene expression profiles.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific tasks performed. The mRMR method was used to rank genes based on their relevance to specific conditions and their redundancy. This process involved analyzing gene expression profiles for 585 colorectal cancer patients, which included quantile normalization and averaging probes corresponding to the same gene. The mRMR software, implemented in C/C++, was utilized for this ranking.\n\nFollowing the mRMR ranking, the IFS method was employed to determine the optimal number of genes for building classifiers. This involved constructing 500 support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, each time using a different number of top-ranked genes from the mRMR list. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), which is computationally intensive. The metrics calculated for each classifier included Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nThe random walk with restart (RWR) method was also used to identify regions affected by the selected genes and to investigate commonly regulated genes. This process involved iterating over time ticks until the difference between steps was smaller than a predefined threshold (1e-6). The significance of the RWR scores was evaluated by comparing them to scores obtained from 1,000 random permutations.\n\nOverall, the execution time was significant due to the computational demands of these methods, particularly the LOOCV and RWR processes. However, specific execution times were not detailed, as the focus was on the methodological approach and the results obtained.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key metrics to objectively assess the classifier's performance. These metrics included Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics were calculated using true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values.\n\nGiven the imbalance in the sizes of positive and negative samples, MCC was chosen as the major measurement. MCC considers both Sensitivity and Specificity, making it a robust metric for imbalanced datasets.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of genes for building a classifier with high performance and low complexity, an Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) curve was used. The x-axis of this curve represented the number of top genes selected, while the y-axis represented the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) MCCs of the classifiers. The peak or change point of the IFS curve was typically chosen to decide the number of genes to use.\n\nFor the CIN-associated gene selection, the top 34 genes were chosen based on the IFS curve, achieving a LOOCV Sn of 0.932, Sp of 0.696, ACC of 0.877, and MCC of 0.648. Similarly, for CIMP-associated genes, 19 genes were selected with a LOOCV Sn of 0.710, Sp of 0.976, ACC of 0.928, and MCC of 0.744. For MMR-associated genes, 18 genes were chosen with a LOOCV Sn of 0.922, Sp of 0.985, ACC of 0.976, and MCC of 0.902.\n\nThe evaluation process ensured that the selected genes could effectively cluster patients into the correct groups, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the method.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to objectively evaluate the classifiers' performance. These metrics include Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the classifier, while Specificity measures the proportion of true negatives correctly identified. Accuracy provides an overall measure of the classifier's correctness, and MCC is particularly useful in cases of imbalanced datasets as it considers both Sensitivity and Specificity.\n\nThe choice of these metrics is representative of common practices in the literature, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. MCC is particularly valuable in our context due to the imbalance in the sizes of positive and negative samples. This metric provides a balanced measure of the classifier's performance, ensuring that both Sensitivity and Specificity are taken into account.\n\nBy reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our classifiers, ensuring that their performance is assessed from multiple angles. This approach aligns with established standards in the field, making our results comparable to other studies and providing a robust basis for further research.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The publication focuses on the identification of biomarker genes associated with CIN, CIMP, and MMR in colorectal cancer using specific methods (mRMR and IFS) and does not discuss comparisons to publicly available methods or simpler baselines. The evaluation of the methods used is based on internal metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient, rather than comparisons to other methods.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our classifier's performance was conducted using several metrics, including Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Accuracy (ACC), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics were chosen to provide a comprehensive assessment of the classifier's effectiveness, particularly in handling imbalanced datasets.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our results, we employed leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). This method is particularly useful for small datasets, as it maximizes the use of available data by training the model on all but one sample and testing it on the remaining sample. This process is repeated for each sample in the dataset, providing a thorough evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe MCC was selected as the primary measurement due to its ability to consider both Sensitivity and Specificity, making it a reliable metric for imbalanced datasets. The IFS curve, which plots the number of top genes used as features against the LOOCV MCC, helped determine the optimal number of genes for building a classifier with high performance and low complexity. The peak or change point of this curve was typically chosen as the optimal number of genes.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of our findings, we used the random walk with restart (RWR) method. This involved randomly selecting the same number of seed genes and calculating their RWR scores 1,000 times. The significance of the actual RWR score was defined as a permutation P-value, indicating how often the random RWR scores exceeded the actual RWR score. Genes with a permutation P-value smaller than 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the significance of the overlap among CIN, CIMP, and MMR downstream genes using the Super Exact Test in R. The odds ratio of overlap was found to be 60.3, with a P-value smaller than 1e-320, indicating a highly significant overlap.\n\nThese statistical evaluations provide confidence in the performance and significance of our method, demonstrating its superiority in identifying relevant genes and understanding the molecular cross-talk among CIN, CIMP, and MMR in colorectal cancer.",
