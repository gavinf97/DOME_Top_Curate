  "dataset/splits": "The datasets used in the experiments are divided into three splits: training, validation, and testing. The distribution of data points in each split varies depending on the specific dataset.\n\nFor the Ecoli dataset, there are 180 data points in the training split, 78 in the validation split, and 78 in the testing split. The Diabetes dataset has 384 data points in the training split, 22 in the validation split, and 192 in the testing split.

  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in our study were split into three distinct sets: training, validation, and testing. This division was done to ensure that the training and test sets were independent, thereby preventing data leakage and ensuring a fair evaluation of the models. The datasets were divided without any overlap between the sets, meaning that each data point appeared in only one of the three sets.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, we employed a 20-fold cross-validation method. This approach involved dividing the dataset into 20 subsets, using 19 of these subsets for training and the remaining one for testing. This process was repeated 20 times, each time with a different subset used as the test set. The results were then averaged over these 20 trials to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in our study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets. The datasets were chosen from well-known benchmark datasets, ensuring that they are representative of the types of data commonly encountered in machine learning research. The attributes of all datasets were normalized to the range [-1, 1] to ensure fairness in the comparison of different algorithms. This normalization process helps to mitigate the effects of differing scales in the data, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the algorithms' performance.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets used in our study are from previously reported studies and are available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This repository is an online resource that provides a collection of databases for the machine learning community. The datasets are freely available for download and use under the terms specified by the repository, which typically include proper citation of the original source.\n\nTo ensure fairness and reproducibility, all input data were normalized to the range [-1, 1]. This normalization process is crucial for comparing different algorithms on an equal footing. The normalization formula used is:\n\nz* = (z - z_min) / (z_max - z_min)\n\nwhere z is the original data point, z_min is the minimum value in the dataset, and z_max is the maximum value.\n\nThe datasets include both classification and regression problems. For classification, we used eight benchmark datasets: Ecoli, Pima Indians Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Iris, Heart Disease, Glass Identification, Image Segmentation, and Statlog. For regression, we used five benchmark datasets: Breast Cancer, Parkinson, SinC, Servo, and Yacht Hydrodynamics.\n\nThe datasets were divided into training, validation, and testing sets without overlap. This division ensures that the models are trained and evaluated on distinct subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting. The specific splits for each dataset are detailed in the respective tables provided in the publication.\n\nThe use of public datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ensures that our results are reproducible and can be verified by other researchers. The repository's terms of use require proper citation, which we have adhered to in our publication. This approach promotes transparency and facilitates further research in the field.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm presented in this work is an artificial immune system extreme learning machine (AIS-ELM). This algorithm combines the principles of artificial immune systems (AIS) with extreme learning machines (ELM). ELM is a type of feedforward neural network that is known for its fast learning speed and good generalization performance. However, ELM can sometimes fall into local optima due to the random generation of parameters. To address this issue, AIS is employed to optimize the ELM, ensuring a better initial weight set and avoiding local optima.\n\nThe AIS-ELM algorithm is not entirely new; it builds upon existing methods like PSO-ELM, SaE-ELM, and DSA-ELM, which also aim to optimize ELM using different evolutionary algorithms. The novelty of AIS-ELM lies in its use of the artificial immune system, which provides global search ability and good convergence properties. This makes AIS-ELM more efficient in optimizing ELM compared to other evolutionary algorithms.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is not explicitly stated. However, it is common for interdisciplinary research to be published in journals that cover a broader range of topics. In this case, the algorithm's application in computational intelligence and neuroscience may have influenced the choice of publication venue. Additionally, the focus of the paper is on the performance verification of AIS-ELM in classification and regression tasks, which may be more aligned with the scope of journals in these fields.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model discussed in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it focuses on optimizing the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) using an artificial immune system (AIS). The AIS-ELM approach involves using evolutionary methods to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of the ELM, rather than combining predictions from multiple machine-learning algorithms.\n\nThe AIS-ELM model utilizes processes such as cloning, mutation, and substitution to refine the parameters of the ELM. This optimization aims to improve the model's performance on both classification and regression tasks. The training data for the AIS-ELM is independent and normalized to ensure fairness in comparisons with other algorithms.\n\nThe experiments conducted compare the AIS-ELM with other optimization methods for ELM, such as DS-ELM, PSO-ELM, and SaE-ELM, as well as traditional ELM, SVM, and BP. The results demonstrate that AIS-ELM achieves better testing accuracy and generalization performance with more compact networks, indicating its effectiveness in optimizing the ELM.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the fairness and effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithm. All input data were normalized to the range [-1, 1]. This normalization process involved transforming the original data using the formula:\n\nz* = (z - z_min) / (z_max - z_min)\n\nwhere z is the original data point, z_min is the minimum value in the dataset, and z_max is the maximum value. This step is essential to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process, preventing any single feature from dominating due to its scale.\n\nAdditionally, the datasets were divided into three distinct sets: training, validation, and testing. This division was done without overlap to ensure that the model's performance could be accurately evaluated on unseen data. The training set was used to train the model, the validation set was used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set was used to evaluate the final performance of the model.\n\nFor the classification problems, we used eight benchmark datasets, including Ecoli, Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Heart Disease, Iris, Glass, Image, and Satellite. Each dataset had a specific number of attributes and classes, and the division into training, validation, and testing sets varied accordingly. A 20-fold cross-validation method was employed to get the average of 20 repeated experiments, minimizing the error and ensuring the robustness of our results.\n\nIn the regression problems, we used five benchmark datasets: Breast Cancer, Parkinson, SinC, Servo, and Yacht Hydro. Similar to the classification datasets, these were also normalized and divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The normalization and division processes were consistent across all datasets to maintain uniformity in our experiments.\n\nThe normalization and division of datasets are fundamental preprocessing steps that ensure the reliability and comparability of our results. By standardizing the input data and using a consistent validation method, we aimed to provide a fair and comprehensive evaluation of our algorithm's performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process described, several parameters are utilized to ensure the effective functioning of the model. The primary parameters include the initial values of `a` and `b`, which are randomly generated within the range of [-1, 1]. These values are crucial for calculating each antibody's fitness using validation data.\n\nThe mutation probability of the clonal antibody, denoted as `P_mutate`, is another critical parameter. This probability is influenced by the fitness of the antibody and is designed to avoid local optima by ensuring that the directions of mutation do not align, thus promoting diversity.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of elements in the antibody, `N_antibody`, and the probability of transition from zero to some number `T` are essential parameters. The bit positions `a` and `b`, along with the number of bits `k` that must be flipped to mutate from 0 to `T`, are also considered. The mutation probability of a bit given a contiguous region, `r`, is another parameter that falls within the range of 0 to 1.\n\nThe stimulus region `ε`, where the antibody can bind to any antigenic complement, is also a key parameter. This region helps in adjusting the range of mutation based on the fitness value, ensuring that antibodies with smaller fitness values undergo fewer mutations, while those with larger fitness values experience more significant changes.\n\nIn summary, the model employs a set of parameters that include initial values, mutation probabilities, bit positions, and stimulus regions. These parameters are selected and adjusted to optimize the performance of the model, ensuring that it evolves towards global optimization while maintaining diversity and avoiding local optima.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized eight benchmark classification datasets, each with a distinct number of input features. The datasets and their respective features are as follows:\n\n* Ecoli: 7 features\n* Diabetes: 8 features\n* Epileptic Seizure: 179 features\n* Heart Disease: 75 features\n* Iris: 4 features\n* Glass: 9 features\n* Image: 19 features\n* Satellite: 36 features\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed as part of our methodology. The input features for each dataset were used as provided in the benchmark datasets. Normalization was applied to the input features to ensure fairness in comparisons across different algorithms. The normalization process involved scaling the features to the range [-1, 1]. This step was crucial to maintain consistency and to prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process due to its scale. The normalization formula used was:\n\nz* = (z - z_min) / (z_max - z_min)\n\nwhere z is the original feature value, z_min is the minimum value of the feature, and z_max is the maximum value of the feature. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's training and evaluation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our optimization process, we employ an algorithm that generates initial values for parameters randomly within a specified range. This approach ensures that the number of parameters can indeed be much larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in neural network models.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of overfitting, we utilize validation data instead of training data to calculate each antibody’s fitness. This strategy helps to alleviate potential overfitting by providing an independent dataset to evaluate the model's performance. The fitness of each antibody is determined using a specific equation that involves the validation data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nThe mutation process in our algorithm is designed to introduce diversity and prevent the solution from getting stuck in local optima. The mutation probability is adjusted based on the fitness of the antibodies, with smaller fitness values leading to smaller mutation changes and vice versa. This adaptive mutation strategy helps to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the algorithm does not underfit the data.\n\nAdditionally, the clonal selection principle is employed to maintain diversity within the antibody population, which has been proven effective in previous studies. The algorithm iteratively replaces antibodies with better fitness, driving the population towards global optimization. This process ensures that the model does not underfit the data by continuously improving the fitness of the antibodies.\n\nIn summary, our fitting method addresses both overfitting and underfitting by using validation data for fitness calculation, adaptive mutation probabilities, and the clonal selection principle. These strategies collectively ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and does not underfit the training data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our work, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One key strategy was the use of validation data to calculate each antibody’s fitness. This approach helps to alleviate possible overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on data that was not used during training. By doing so, we ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a mutation process that adjusts the mutation probability based on the fitness of the antibodies. This dynamic adjustment helps in exploring the solution space more effectively and avoids getting stuck in local optima, which is crucial for preventing overfitting. The mutation probability is designed to change directions periodically, further enhancing the diversity of the solutions and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nMoreover, the substitution phase in our algorithm involves comparing the fitness of clonal antibodies with their original counterparts. Only those clonal antibodies that show improved fitness replace the original ones. This iterative process ensures that the antibody population evolves towards global optimization, thereby reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our regularization methods include the use of validation data for fitness calculation, dynamic mutation probabilities, and a substitution phase that promotes global optimization. These techniques collectively help in preventing overfitting and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our experiments are explicitly detailed within the publication. Specifically, for the AIS-ELM algorithm, parameters such as `a`, `b`, `ε`, `k`, and `r` are set to 10, 50, 0.1, 5, and 0.2, respectively. These values are chosen to ensure optimal performance across various benchmark datasets.\n\nThe input data for all experiments is normalized to the range [-1, 1] to maintain fairness in comparisons. The number of hidden neurons varies depending on the specific problem being addressed, and these details are provided in the respective experimental sections.\n\nThe optimization schedule involves several key steps, including initialization, cloning, mutation, and substitution phases. These processes are designed to evolve the antibody population towards global optimization, ensuring that the final solution is robust and accurate.\n\nModel files and specific optimization parameters are not directly provided in the text, but the methodology and configurations are thoroughly described, allowing for replication of the experiments. The publication does not specify the availability of model files or optimization parameters under a particular license, but the detailed descriptions and parameter settings should enable researchers to implement and test the AIS-ELM algorithm independently.\n\nFor those interested in replicating the experiments, the detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including Ecoli, Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Iris, Heart Disease, Glass, Image, and Satellite, are provided in Table 1. This table includes the number of data attributes, classes, and the division of data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n\nIn summary, while specific model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly available for download, the comprehensive details provided in the publication should suffice for researchers to reproduce the experiments and validate the results.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model discussed in this publication is not inherently blackbox. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its variants, such as AIS-ELM, DS-ELM, PSO-ELM, and SaE-ELM, offer a degree of transparency due to their structure and the mathematical formulations involved.\n\nThe standard ELM, for instance, involves a single hidden layer feedforward network where the hidden layer parameters (input weights and biases) are randomly assigned and not adjusted during training. The output weights are then analytically determined using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, which provides a clear mathematical relationship between the input data, the hidden layer outputs, and the final predictions. This process can be summarized by the equation Hβ = T, where H is the hidden layer output matrix, β is the output weight matrix, and T is the target matrix. This equation shows how the input data is transformed through the hidden layer to produce the output, making the model's internal workings more interpretable compared to other blackbox models.\n\nAdditionally, the hidden layer output matrix H can be explicitly constructed, and its columns represent the output vectors of the hidden nodes with respect to the input samples. This matrix, along with the output weight matrix β, provides a clear view of how the model processes input data to generate predictions. The use of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse to solve for β further enhances the interpretability, as it ensures that the solution is unique and provides the smallest norm of weights, which can be seen as a form of regularization.\n\nIn summary, the ELM and its variants are not blackbox models. Their structure and the mathematical formulations used to determine the output weights offer a degree of transparency, allowing for a clearer understanding of how the model processes input data to generate predictions. This transparency is a key advantage of these models over other machine learning algorithms that may lack such interpretability.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed is applicable to both classification and regression problems. It is designed to handle a variety of benchmark datasets, including those specifically for classification and regression tasks. For classification, the model has been tested on eight benchmark datasets such as Ecoli, Pima Indians Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Iris, Heart Disease, Glass Identification, Image Segmentation, and Statlog. For regression, it has been evaluated on five benchmark datasets including Breast Cancer, Parkinson, SinC, Servo, and Yacht Hydro.\n\nThe model's performance is measured using metrics such as training time, testing accuracy, and the number of hidden nodes. In regression tasks, the model aims to achieve better generalization with more compact networks, often resulting in smaller root mean square error (RMSE) compared to other algorithms. In classification tasks, the model strives for higher accuracy and faster training times.\n\nThe experiments involved normalizing input data to ensure fairness and using a 20-fold cross-validation method to minimize error. The model's parameters, such as input weights and hidden biases, are optimized through processes like cloning, mutation, and substitution, which are part of the artificial immune system (AIS) approach integrated into the extreme learning machine (ELM) framework. This integration aims to enhance the model's performance and efficiency across different types of problems.",
  "model/duration": "In the \"Execution Time\" subsection, we focus on the computational efficiency of our proposed model, AIS-ELM, in comparison to other algorithms. For classification tasks, AIS-ELM demonstrates a training speed that is significantly faster than BP and SVM, although it is slightly slower than traditional ELM due to the iterative nature of the algorithm. This is evident from the results on three benchmark classification problems, where AIS-ELM's training times are considerably lower than those of BP and SVM.\n\nFor regression tasks, the training times of AIS-ELM are also compared across five benchmark datasets. Traditional ELM remains the fastest due to its simpler mechanism, but AIS-ELM shows competitive performance with other optimized ELM variants like DS-ELM, PSO-ELM, and SaE-ELM. The training times for AIS-ELM are consistently lower than those of these variants, indicating its efficiency.\n\nOverall, while traditional ELM is the fastest algorithm due to its straightforward approach, AIS-ELM strikes a balance between speed and performance, making it a robust choice for both classification and regression tasks. The detailed training times for various datasets and algorithms are presented in the respective tables, providing a clear comparison of the computational efficiency of AIS-ELM against other methods.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive comparison with several other algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets. The experiments were divided into two main parts: classification and regression tasks.\n\nFor the classification tasks, five algorithms were tested on eight benchmark classification problems. These datasets included Ecoli, Pima Indians Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Iris, Heart Disease, Glass Identification, Image Segmentation, and Statlog. The datasets were normalized to the range [-1,1] to ensure fairness in comparison. A 20-fold cross-validation method was employed to obtain the average results from 20 repeated experiments, which helped to minimize errors. The datasets were divided into training, validation, and testing sets without overlap, and these sets remained consistent across all trials.\n\nThe performance metrics evaluated included training time, testing accuracy (mean and variance), and the number of hidden nodes. The results demonstrated that the proposed method, AIS-ELM, outperformed other algorithms such as DS-ELM, PSO-ELM, SaE-ELM, and traditional ELM in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the classification tasks, the method was also evaluated on three benchmark classification problems to compare training times with SVM, BP, and traditional ELM. The datasets used for this comparison included Satellite, Image, and Epileptic Seizure. The results showed that AIS-ELM had significantly shorter training times compared to SVM and BP, while also achieving competitive or superior performance.\n\nThe experimental environment consisted of MATLAB R2014b running on a Windows PC with an Intel 2.7 GHz CPU and 8GB of RAM. The parameters for AIS-ELM were set as follows: a=10, b=50, ε=0.1, k=5, and r=0.2. These parameters were chosen to optimize the performance of the algorithm across the various datasets.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved rigorous testing and comparison with established algorithms, ensuring that the proposed method's performance was thoroughly validated. The use of multiple benchmark datasets and cross-validation techniques provided robust evidence of the method's effectiveness and efficiency.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our algorithms, we focused on several key performance metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. For classification problems, we primarily reported the training time, testing accuracy (both mean and standard deviation), and the number of hidden nodes. These metrics were chosen to provide a clear picture of the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm. The training time indicates how quickly the algorithm can learn from the data, while the testing accuracy measures how well the algorithm generalizes to unseen data. The number of hidden nodes is crucial as it reflects the complexity of the model, with fewer nodes often indicating a more compact and potentially more interpretable model.\n\nFor regression problems, we reported the training time, testing accuracy (mean and standard deviation), and the number of hidden nodes as well. Additionally, we included the root mean square error (RMSE) to provide a more detailed assessment of the algorithm's performance in predicting continuous values. The RMSE gives a sense of the magnitude of the errors, which is particularly important in regression tasks where the exact values matter.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature and are representative of the standard practices in evaluating machine learning algorithms. By comparing these metrics across different algorithms, we aimed to provide a fair and thorough evaluation of their performance. The use of a 20-fold cross-validation method further ensured that our results were robust and not dependent on a particular split of the data. This approach helps in minimizing errors and providing a more reliable estimate of the algorithms' performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithm, AIS-ELM, against several other methods on benchmark datasets. We conducted experiments on both classification and regression problems.\n\nFor classification, we compared AIS-ELM with DS-ELM, PSO-ELM, SaE-ELM, and traditional ELM across eight benchmark datasets: Ecoli, Diabetes, Epileptic Seizure, Heart Disease, Iris, Glass, Image, and Satellite.

The performance metrics included training time, testing accuracy's mean and variance.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the training time of AIS-ELM with SVM, BP, and traditional ELM on three benchmark classification problems. While AIS-ELM was slower than traditional ELM due to iterations, it significantly outperformed BP and SVM in terms of training speed.\n\nFor regression, we evaluated the five algorithms on five benchmark datasets: Breast Cancer, Parkinson, SinC, Servo, and Yacht Hydro. The attributes of all datasets were normalized to [-1,1], and we focused on training time and testing accuracy's mean and variance. A 20-fold cross-validation method was employed to get the average of 20 repeated experiments.\n\nThe results demonstrated that AIS-ELM achieved better performance than the other four algorithms on regression problems, with a smaller RMSE and more compact networks. Overall, the comparisons showed that AIS-ELM is a robust and efficient method for both classification and regression tasks.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In the evaluation of our method, we employed a 20-fold cross-validation technique to ensure the robustness of our results. This approach helps to minimize errors and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. By dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets without overlap, and keeping these sets consistent across all trials, we ensured that our results are not due to random chance.\n\nThe performance metrics reported include the mean and variance of the testing accuracy. These statistics give an indication of the consistency and reliability of the model's performance. However, specific confidence intervals for the performance metrics are not explicitly provided in the results. To assess the statistical significance of our method's superiority over others and baselines, we would typically conduct hypothesis tests or use statistical measures such as p-values. While the detailed statistical tests are not outlined in the provided information, the use of cross-validation and the reporting of variance suggest a rigorous approach to evaluating performance.\n\nIn summary, while the evaluation provides mean and variance for testing accuracy, explicit confidence intervals and detailed statistical significance tests are not presented. The use of cross-validation and the reporting of variance indicate a commitment to robust evaluation, but further statistical analysis would be needed to definitively claim superiority over other methods.",

The datasets employed for both classification and regression tasks are well-known benchmark datasets, which can be accessed through various public repositories. However, the specific evaluation results, including the training and testing accuracies, training times, and other performance metrics, are presented within the publication. These results are derived from the experiments conducted using the described algorithms on the specified datasets. The datasets themselves are widely used in the machine learning community and can be obtained from standard sources, ensuring reproducibility of the experiments. The algorithms and methodologies described in the paper are designed to be implementable by researchers, allowing them to replicate the results using the same datasets."
