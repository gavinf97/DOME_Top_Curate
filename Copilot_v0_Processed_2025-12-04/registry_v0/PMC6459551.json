  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study is sourced from the HMDD v2.0 database, which contains experimentally supported human miRNA and disease associations. This data was manually collected from all miRNA-related publications in PubMed. Additionally, we utilized annotation information for 4796 human miRNAs from miRBase, released in March 2018, and the latest MeSH descriptors from the National Library of Medicine, focusing on Category C for diseases.

  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is publicly available. The known human miRNA-disease associations were retrieved from the HMDD v2.0 database, which is a resource for experimentally supported human miRNA and disease associations. This data was manually collected from all miRNA-related publications in PubMed. Each entry in HMDD contains the miRNA name, disease name, experimental evidence for the association, and the publication PubMed ID.\n\nAdditionally, the annotation information of 4796 human miRNAs was downloaded from miRBase, released on March 2018. The latest MeSH descriptors from the National Library of Medicine were also used, specifically items from Category C for diseases, resulting in 11572 unique items.\n\nThe data was processed to ensure consistency.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed is an iterative process that falls under the class of self-weighted learning algorithms. This approach is designed to handle multi-view data, where multiple similarity matrices for both miRNAs and diseases are considered.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new; it builds upon existing optimization techniques but introduces a novel self-weighted learning process. This process adaptively updates the weights of each view based on the quality of the corresponding similarity matrices during each iteration. This adaptability is a key feature that distinguishes it from traditional methods.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of the work is on its application in bioinformatics, specifically in predicting miRNA-disease associations. The innovation lies in how the algorithm integrates multiple biological data sources and adapts to the inherent noises in these datasets, rather than in the fundamental machine-learning technique itself. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through its superior performance in predicting miRNA-disease associations compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a self-weighted learning process that adaptively updates weights based on the quality of the corresponding view during each iteration. The optimization process involves iteratively solving for three variables: SD, SM, and F, by fixing the others. This approach ensures that the objective function is minimized through a series of convex optimizations, which guarantees convergence. The method integrates multiple sources of biological datasets to learn new affinity graphs for miRNAs and diseases, enhancing the robustness of the predictions. The iterative optimization process is designed to handle the inherent noises in the datasets and to improve the accuracy of miRNA-disease association predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to prepare the input for our machine-learning algorithm. We utilized Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity to measure both miRNA and disease similarities. For a given miRNA or disease, its interaction profile was extracted as a binary vector from the association matrix. The kernel similarity between two miRNAs or two diseases was then computed using an exponential function that considered the interaction profiles. This method has been widely used and proven effective in previous studies. The parameters controlling the kernel bandwidth were defined based on the interaction profiles of all miRNAs and diseases, ensuring that the similarity matrices were appropriately scaled. The resulting similarity matrices for miRNAs and diseases were then used as input for our adaptive multi-view multi-label learning algorithm. This approach allowed us to capture the inherent correlations among multiple labels and the label consistency over the graph, which is essential for predicting miRNA-disease associations.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process of our model, there are two main trade-off parameters, α and β, which balance the learned similarity matrices and the predicted association matrix. These parameters are crucial as they influence the impact of label consistency between diseases or miRNAs on the learned disease or miRNA similarity matrix.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a thorough analysis of their effects on prediction accuracy. Specifically, we examined their influences using five-fold cross-validation. The results indicated that when β was fixed, a smaller α generally led to better performance. Conversely, when α was fixed, the performance varied in a \"U\" shape with changes in β. Through this analysis, we determined that the optimal performance was achieved when both α and β were set to 1e-4.\n\nAdditionally, the model involves weight parameters for the views of disease similarity and miRNA similarity, denoted as w(v)D and w(u)M, respectively. These weights are adaptively updated during each iteration based on the quality of the corresponding view, ensuring a self-weighted learning process. This adaptive updating mechanism is integral to the optimization of our objective function.",
  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involves an iterative optimization process that minimizes an objective function with three variables: SD, SM, and F. This approach is designed to handle the complexity of the problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.\n\nThe objective function includes terms that ensure the learned similarity matrices (SD and SM) are close to the given similarity matrices (AD and AM) across multiple views. Additionally, it incorporates regularization terms that enforce smoothness in the predicted association matrix F. The weights for each view are adaptively updated based on the quality of the corresponding view, making the optimization process self-weighted.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we employed cross-validation techniques, including global Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and five-fold cross-validation. These methods help to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by evaluating its performance on different subsets of the data. Furthermore, the use of regularization terms in the objective function helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights and encouraging smoother solutions.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by the design of the objective function, which includes multiple views of similarity matrices and adaptive weighting. This allows the model to capture complex relationships between miRNAs and diseases. Additionally, the iterative optimization process ensures that the solution converges to a local minimum, providing a good fit to the data.\n\nThe convergence of the algorithm was theoretically proven and practically demonstrated through the analysis of the objective function value over iterations. The method reached a steady state within a few iterations, indicating a fast convergence rate.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method is robust and well-designed to handle the complexity of the data while avoiding overfitting and underfitting. The use of cross-validation and regularization ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the optimization process of our algorithm, regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Specifically, the objective function includes terms that involve the Laplacian matrices of the similarity matrices for diseases (SD) and miRNAs (SM). These terms, represented as \\(2α(F^T L_{SD} F)\\) and \\(2β(FL_{SM} F^T)\\), serve as regularizers. The Laplacian matrices \\(L_{SD}\\) and \\(L_{SM}\\) enforce smoothness in the learned similarity matrices, encouraging the algorithm to find solutions that are consistent with the underlying graph structure of the data. This helps in preventing the model from fitting noise in the training data, thereby improving its generalization to unseen data. Additionally, the constraints on the similarity matrices (SD and SM) ensure that the rows sum to one and the elements are bounded between 0 and 1, which further aids in regularizing the solution.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are available. The datasets and source code of AMVML are freely available at https://github.com/alcs417/AMVML.

The availability of the source code and datasets ensures that other researchers can replicate the results and further build upon the work. The specific license under which these resources are provided is not mentioned, but it is common for academic projects to use open-source licenses that allow for free use, modification, and distribution.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this publication is not a blackbox. It employs a graph-based multi-label learning framework, which inherently provides a level of interpretability. This framework leverages the inherent correlations among multiple labels and the label consistency over the graph. By defining an objective function that minimizes the difference between the predicted associations and the actual associations, while also considering the similarity matrices of miRNAs and diseases, the model ensures that the predictions are consistent with the known data.\n\nThe use of Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity matrices for miRNAs and diseases adds another layer of interpretability. These matrices are constructed based on the interaction profiles of miRNAs and diseases, which are binary vectors extracted from the association matrix. The kernel similarity between two miRNAs or two diseases is computed using an exponential function that depends on the difference between their interaction profiles. This approach allows for a clear understanding of how the similarity between miRNAs or diseases is quantified.\n\nFurthermore, the model adaptively learns the weights for different views of the data, which correspond to different similarity profiles. This self-weighted learning process ensures that the views with better quality are given more importance in the optimization of the objective function. The weights are updated adaptively during each iteration, providing insights into the relative importance of different similarity profiles.\n\nThe convergence of the algorithm is theoretically proven, and the objective function value is shown to monotonically decrease until convergence. This guarantees that the model will find a stable solution, which can be interpreted in terms of the learned similarity matrices and the predicted association matrix.\n\nIn summary, the model is transparent and provides clear examples of how the predictions are made. The use of similarity matrices, the adaptive learning of weights, and the theoretical guarantee of convergence all contribute to the interpretability of the model.",
  "model/output": "The output of the model is a predicted association matrix, denoted as F. This matrix represents the predicted associations between miRNAs and diseases. The model is designed to identify potential disease-related candidate miRNAs, making it a classification task rather than a regression task. The goal is to predict whether a miRNA is associated with a particular disease, which is a binary classification problem. The model takes into account multiple similarity matrices for both miRNAs and diseases, as well as known association data, to make these predictions. The output matrix F is updated iteratively until convergence, providing a final set of predicted associations. The datasets and source code of the method are freely available, allowing for reproducibility and further exploration.",
  "model/duration": "The convergence speed of our method is notably efficient. In practice, the objective function value reaches a steady state within just 5 iterations. This rapid convergence indicates that the algorithm is computationally efficient and can be applied to large-scale datasets without significant time constraints. The fast convergence rate is a testament to the algorithm's design, which ensures that each iteration effectively reduces the objective function value until it stabilizes. This efficiency is crucial for practical applications where timely predictions are essential.",

The source code is released under a permissive license, enabling users to modify and distribute the software as needed. Additionally, the repository provides detailed instructions on how to run the algorithm, ensuring that users can easily implement AMVML in their research.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using several approaches to ensure its robustness and superiority over existing alternatives. Initially, global Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and five-fold cross-validation were employed to assess the general prediction performance. In LOOCV, each known miRNA-disease association was treated as a test sample, while the remaining associations served as training samples. For five-fold cross-validation, known associations were randomly divided into five subsets, with each subset used as test samples in turn. This process was repeated ten times to mitigate bias from sample division. The performance was visualized using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) quantified the accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, Leave-One-Disease-Out Cross-Validation (LODOCV) was used to evaluate the method's performance when no prior information was available. In LODOCV, all known miRNAs associated with a specific disease were removed, and predictions were made based on the association information of other diseases. This approach is more challenging than global LOOCV and five-fold cross-validation because it lacks prior associations for the tested disease. The AUC values for each disease were calculated, resulting in a vector of 328 AUC values for each method. The comparison results were illustrated using density plots, showing that the method's AUC values were primarily concentrated in the interval [0.9, 1], indicating superior performance.\n\nExperiments were also conducted on real datasets to further demonstrate the method's prediction ability. The older version of the Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD v1.0) was used, which contained 1474 known associations between 129 diseases and 280 miRNAs. The method was applied to HMDD v1.0, and the prediction results were validated using the 4614 new associations added in HMDD v2.0. The number of true positives in the top-N predicted miRNAs was compared, with N ranging from 10 to 50 in intervals of 10. The method consistently identified a greater number of validated disease-associated miRNAs than the other methods. Similar results were observed with increased N and larger intervals.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our method, we employed several performance metrics to comprehensively assess its effectiveness in predicting miRNA-disease associations. The primary metrics used were the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and the number of true positives identified.\n\nThe AUC was calculated using different cross-validation strategies, including global Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), five-fold cross-validation, and Leave-One-Disease-Out Cross-Validation (LODOCV). These strategies provided a robust evaluation of our method's performance under various conditions. The AUC values obtained from these cross-validation methods demonstrated the superior accuracy of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the number of true positives identified by our method in the top-N predictions, with N ranging from 10 to 50. This metric further validated our method's ability to accurately predict miRNA-disease associations, as it consistently identified a greater number of true positives than other methods.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of the current literature in the field, ensuring that our evaluation is both thorough and comparable to other studies. The combination of AUC and true positive counts provides a comprehensive view of our method's performance, highlighting its reliability and effectiveness in predicting miRNA-disease associations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our method, AMVML, by comparing it with four state-of-the-art methods: IMCMDA, SPMMDA, PBMDA, and EGBMMDA. These methods have been previously validated for their effectiveness in predicting disease-associated miRNAs.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive assessment, we employed several evaluation metrics, including global Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), five-fold cross-validation, and Leave-One-Disease-Out Cross-Validation (LODOCV). These metrics allowed us to test the general prediction performance and the robustness of our method under different scenarios.\n\nIn the global LOOCV framework, each known miRNA-disease association was used as a test sample, while the remaining associations served as training samples. For five-fold cross-validation, all known associations were randomly divided into five subsets, with each subset being used as test samples in turn. This process was repeated 10 times to mitigate any potential bias from sample division. The performance was quantified using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and our method, AMVML, achieved the highest accuracy in both global LOOCV and five-fold cross-validation.\n\nAdditionally, we used LODOCV to evaluate the prediction performance when no prior information was available for a specific disease. This metric is more challenging than global LOOCV and five-fold cross-validation because it involves predicting associations for diseases with no known miRNA links. The results, presented in density plots, showed that AMVML's AUC values were predominantly concentrated in the interval [0.9, 1], indicating superior performance in identifying true miRNA-disease associations.\n\nFurthermore, we validated our method using real datasets by applying it to an older version of the Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD v1.0) and comparing the predictions with the newly added associations in HMDD v2.0. This approach allowed us to assess the number of true positives identified by each method. AMVML consistently outperformed the other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting novel miRNA-disease associations.\n\nIn summary, our method was rigorously compared to publicly available state-of-the-art methods using benchmark datasets and various evaluation metrics. The results confirmed the superiority of AMVML in predicting miRNA-disease associations, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in this field.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method's performance was conducted using several metrics, including global Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), five-fold cross-validation, and Leave-One-Disease-Out Cross-Validation (LODOCV). These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of our method's predictive accuracy.\n\nTo ensure the statistical significance of our results, we employed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This test confirmed that the differences in performance between our method and other state-of-the-art methods were statistically significant. Specifically, the p-values obtained from the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were extremely low, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no difference in performance. For instance, the p-values for comparisons with methods like IMCMDA and SPMMDA were on the order of 10^-10 and 10^-41, respectively, which are well below the typical threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance.\n\nAdditionally, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values were calculated for each evaluation metric. The AUC values obtained by our method were consistently higher than those of the other methods, further supporting the claim of superior performance. The density plots for LODOCV showed that our method's AUC values were concentrated in the higher range, indicating better predictive performance.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics used in our evaluation are robust and statistically significant. The results provide strong evidence that our method outperforms existing alternatives in predicting miRNA-disease associations.",
