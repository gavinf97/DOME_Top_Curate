  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study is derived from two primary sources: the MGH Sleep Lab and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The MGH Sleep Lab dataset comprises 2,532 sleep electroencephalograms (EEGs), including 167 from individuals with significant neurological or psychiatric diseases. The SHHS dataset, on the other hand, consists of 1,974 sleep EEGs, with 987 participants having EEGs from two visits approximately five years apart. This longitudinal aspect of the SHHS dataset is particularly valuable for evaluating the model's reliability over time.\n\nThe MGH dataset includes participants aged between 18 and 80 years who underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) between 2008 and 2012. The EEG signals in this dataset are recorded from six channels: frontal, central, and occipital, each referenced to the contralateral mastoid. The signals are sampled at 200Hz and segmented into 30-second epochs, scored by trained technicians according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine standards.\n\nThe SHHS dataset, while smaller in terms of the number of EEGs, provides a unique opportunity to study the progression of brain aging over time. The inclusion criteria for the SHHS dataset ensure high-quality EEG and sleep stage scoring, making it a robust source for longitudinal analysis.\n\nBoth datasets have been used in previous studies, with the SHHS dataset being particularly notable for its contributions to understanding sleep-related health outcomes. The large size of these datasets ensures statistical power and minimizes selection bias, which is crucial for the development and validation of machine learning models aimed at predicting brain age from sleep EEG data.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was partitioned into two main splits: a training set and a testing set. The training set consisted of 1,343 EEGs from healthy participants, while the testing set included 1,189 EEGs. Within the testing set, 167 participants had significant neurological or psychiatric diseases, leaving 1,022 healthy participants. The dataset also included a subset from the SHHS dataset, which contained repeated EEGs from the same participants in two visits about five years apart. This subset was used to evaluate the longitudinal reliability of the model at the population level. From the SHHS dataset, 987 EEGs from the first visit and 987 paired EEGs from the second visit were used. The average difference in chronological age between the two visits was 5.2 years.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and testing sets to ensure statistically unbiased estimates of model performance. The MGH dataset, consisting of 2,532 sleep EEGs, was partitioned into a healthy training set of 1,343 EEGs and a testing set of 1,189 EEGs. The testing set included 167 individuals with significant neurological or psychiatric disease, while the remaining 1,022 were healthy.\n\nTo maintain independence between the training and testing sets, strict separation of participants was enforced. This means that the individuals in the training set were not included in the testing set, and vice versa. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on data it has not seen during training, providing a more accurate assessment of its generalizability.\n\nThe size of the datasets used in this study is notably large compared to other relevant \"brain age\" studies. This large size helps to ensure statistical power and minimizes selection bias. A large training set aids in preventing the model from overfitting to a particular dataset, thereby improving its ability to generalize when applied to new data. Similarly, a large testing set allows for accurate statistical measurement of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of size and diversity. The inclusion of a significant number of EEGs from individuals with neurological or psychiatric diseases adds to the robustness of the model, as it can be tested on a more representative sample of the population.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly released. The dataset consists of de-identified polysomnogram (PSG) data acquired at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between 2008 and 2012. The dataset includes EEG signals from 2,532 participants, with a median age of 50 years, and an equal gender distribution. The dataset also includes a subset from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), which contains repeated EEGs from the same participants in two visits about 5 years apart.\n\nThe Partners Institutional Review Board approved the retrospective analysis of this dataset, ensuring that the data was de-identified and that no additional consent was required for its use in this study. The dataset includes participants aged between 18 and 80 years who underwent diagnostic PSG and had a clinical diagnosis available from five years before to one year after the PSG recording. Participants with missing sleep stages were excluded to avoid confounding effects.\n\nThe dataset was partitioned into a training set and a testing set. The training set consisted of 1,343 healthy participants, while the testing set consisted of 1,189 participants, including 167 with significant neurological or psychiatric diseases. The data splits were maintained strictly to achieve statistically unbiased estimates of the model's performance. The results reported are based on the testing set, unless stated otherwise.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a parametric model, which is a class of machine-learning algorithms that are designed to be interpretable. This model improves interpretability by explicitly inspecting each EEG feature and comparing it to an age norm for each feature. This approach contrasts with nonparametric or semi-parametric models, such as kernel methods and Gaussian process models, which estimate age based on the similarity to training examples, where the contribution of each feature is involved implicitly.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithm used is not new; it has been previously utilized in similar studies. The decision to use this established algorithm was driven by its effectiveness in handling the specific characteristics of our dataset and its ability to provide clear insights into the relationship between EEG features and brain age. The focus of our study is on the application of this algorithm to EEG data for brain age prediction, rather than the development of a novel machine-learning technique. Therefore, it was appropriate to publish these findings in a neuroscience journal rather than a machine-learning journal, as the primary contributions lie in the domain of neuroscience and brain health.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in our study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it directly utilizes EEG features to predict brain age. The optimization process involves selecting the optimal hyperparameter λ through a grid search on an internal validation set derived from the training data. This validation set consists of 300 randomly selected EEGs from the training set, ensuring that the training and validation data are strictly separated to maintain statistical unbiasedness.\n\nThe performance metric used for evaluating each hyperparameter is corr(CA, BA) – ∣corr(CA, BAI)∣, where corr(·) denotes Pearson’s correlation. This metric is chosen because correlation is normalized and comparable among different hyperparameter values, providing a clear indication of model performance.\n\nOnce the optimal hyperparameter is determined based on the highest performance on the internal validation set, the validation set is combined with the rest of the training set. The model is then re-trained using the optimal hyperparameter on the combined dataset. This approach ensures that the final model is trained on the entire training set, leveraging all available data to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nThe model's performance is ultimately evaluated on a separate testing set, which includes participants not used in the training or validation phases. This strict separation of training and testing data ensures that the reported results are statistically unbiased and provide a reliable estimate of the model's generalizability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the EEG signals were suitable for feature extraction and model training.\n\nEEG signals were initially filtered to reduce noise and artifacts. A notch filter at 60Hz was applied to minimize line noise, and a bandpass filter from 0.5Hz to 20Hz was used to reduce myogenic artifacts. Epochs with absolute amplitudes larger than 500uV were removed to minimize movement artifacts, and those containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds were also excluded. Additionally, EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, indicated by a 1Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram, were removed.\n\nTo reduce inter-participant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel was normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. This normalization process helped to standardize the data, making it more comparable across different participants.\n\nFor feature extraction, 102 features were extracted from each 30-second epoch, covering both time and frequency domains. These features were then averaged within each of the five sleep stages, resulting in 510 features per EEG recording. The features were log-transformed to render their distributions approximately Gaussian and subsequently z-transformed to have zero mean and unit standard deviation in the training set. The same z-transformation was applied to the testing set to ensure consistency.\n\nThese preprocessing steps ensured that the EEG data were clean, standardized, and ready for input into the machine-learning model, facilitating accurate brain age prediction.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a parametric model for brain age prediction, which allows for explicit inspection and interpretation of each EEG feature. The model considers 510 sleep micro-structure EEG features, which were selected based on their ability to reflect age-related changes in brain activity during sleep.\n\nThe selection of these features was driven by the goal of capturing the nuanced effects of aging on brain activity, as reflected in sleep EEG. This approach contrasts with nonparametric or semi-parametric models, which estimate age based on the similarity to training examples without explicitly detailing the contribution of each feature.\n\nThe use of a parametric model with 510 features ensures that the model is interpretable, as each feature's contribution to the predicted brain age can be explicitly compared to age norms. This interpretability is crucial for understanding how different aspects of sleep EEG relate to brain aging and for identifying potential biomarkers of brain health.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used for the brain age prediction model are derived from sleep EEG data. Specifically, 510 features are extracted from each EEG recording. These features are obtained by averaging 102 features across five sleep stages, covering both time and frequency domains. The features are log-transformed to approximate a Gaussian distribution and then z-transformed to have zero mean and unit standard deviation within the training set. This z-transformation is also applied to the testing set to maintain consistency.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. Instead, the features were directly extracted and processed as described. The extraction and processing of these features were performed using the training set, ensuring that the testing set remained independent and unbiased. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the model's performance evaluation on unseen data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involves a parametric model that uses a large number of EEG features to predict brain age. Specifically, 510 features are extracted from each EEG recording, which is indeed a large number compared to the number of training points. To address potential overfitting, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirst, a large dataset was used, consisting of 2,532 sleep EEGs from the MGH Sleep Lab and 1,974 sleep EEGs from the SHHS dataset. This large sample size helps to ensure that the model does not overfit to a particular dataset, improving its ability to generalize to new data.\n\nSecond, the model includes a regularization term in its objective function, which helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. The objective function minimizes both the mean squared prediction error and the magnitude of the covariance between chronological age and brain age index, with a hyperparameter λ that controls the trade-off between these two components. The optimal value of λ was determined through grid search on an internal validation set, ensuring that the model's performance is robust and not overly tailored to the training data.\n\nThird, the model's performance was evaluated on a separate testing set that was strictly kept separate from the training set. This ensures that the reported results are unbiased and reflect the model's true performance on new, unseen data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was compared to simpler models using fewer features. For instance, age prediction using sleep macro-structure features resulted in a much higher mean absolute deviation and weaker correlation compared to the model using EEG micro-structure features. This comparison demonstrates that the chosen model with 510 features provides a better fit to the data, indicating that underfitting is not a concern.\n\nAdditionally, the use of a parametric model allows for explicit inspection of each EEG feature and comparison to age norms, providing interpretability and ensuring that the model captures relevant age-related patterns in the data. The model's ability to track brain aging longitudinally, with a marginal error of 0.2 to 0.9 years, further supports its validity and generalizability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization technique to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of our brain age prediction model. Specifically, we used a hyperparameter λ to control the trade-off between minimizing the mean squared prediction error and the magnitude of the covariance between chronological age (CA) and brain age index (BAI). The objective function we minimized included two terms: the mean squared prediction error and the magnitude of the covariance between CA and BAI, weighted by λ.\n\nTo determine the optimal value of λ, we performed a grid search on a range of values [0, 1, 5, 10] using an internal validation set of 300 randomly selected EEGs from the training set. The performance metric for each hyperparameter was evaluated using corr(CA, BA) – ∣corr(CA, BAI)∣, where corr(·) denotes Pearson’s correlation. A larger corr(CA, BA) and a smaller ∣corr(CA, BAI)∣ indicate better model performance. This metric was chosen because correlation is normalized and comparable among different hyperparameter values.\n\nOnce the optimal hyperparameter with the best validation performance was determined, the validation set was combined with the rest of the training set, and the model was re-trained using the optimal hyperparameter. This approach helped to ensure that the model did not overfit to the training data and improved its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyperparameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we performed a grid search on the hyperparameter λ, ranging from [0, 1, 5, 10], using a subset of 300 EEGs from the training set as internal validation data. The performance metric for each hyperparameter was evaluated using corr(CA, BA) – ∣corr(CA, BAI)∣, where corr(·) denotes Pearson’s correlation. This metric was chosen for its normalization and comparability among different hyperparameter values.\n\nOnce the optimal hyperparameter was determined based on the best validation performance, the validation set was combined with the rest of the training set, and the model was retrained using this optimal hyperparameter. This process ensured that the model's performance was robust and generalizable.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, these details are not explicitly provided in the publication. The focus was on the methodology and results rather than the specific implementation details or code. Therefore, while the hyperparameter configurations and optimization schedule are reported, the actual model files and optimization parameters are not made available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a parametric model, which enhances interpretability. This type of model allows for explicit inspection of each EEG feature and comparison to age norms for each feature. This approach contrasts with nonparametric or semi-parametric models, such as kernel methods and Gaussian process models, which estimate age based on similarity to training examples, where the contribution of each feature is involved implicitly.\n\nTo illustrate interpretability, consider a scenario where the model predicts an older brain age for an individual. The model can identify the top features contributing most positively to this prediction. For instance, it might highlight specific EEG features that deviate significantly from the age norm. These features can be visualized and compared to the expected values for the individual's chronological age, providing clear insights into what aspects of the EEG data are driving the prediction.\n\nFor example, in a specific case, the model might show that a participant's EEG features related to sleep spindle density during the N2 sleep stage are weaker than expected for their chronological age. This deviation can be directly linked to the predicted older brain age, offering a transparent explanation of the model's output. Such detailed interpretations are crucial for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying brain aging and for identifying potential areas for intervention.",
  "model/output": "The model is a regression model designed to predict brain age (BA) from EEG data. It estimates the brain age of individuals based on their electroencephalogram (EEG) features, rather than classifying them into discrete categories. The primary output of the model is a continuous value representing the predicted brain age, which is then compared to the chronological age (CA) of the participants. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the mean absolute deviation (MAD) between the predicted brain age and the chronological age, as well as the correlation between these two variables. The model aims to minimize the difference between the predicted brain age and the chronological age, indicating its effectiveness in tracking brain aging over time. Additionally, the model's output includes a brain age index (BAI), which is the difference between the predicted brain age and the chronological age, providing insights into the aging process of the brain. The results demonstrate that the model can accurately predict brain age using EEG features, with a higher correlation and lower prediction error compared to using sleep macro-structure features. The model's performance is further validated through longitudinal studies, showing its reliability in tracking brain aging at the population level.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed for this study involved a rigorous process to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model. Initially, a subset of 300 EEGs was randomly selected from the training set to serve as internal validation data. A grid search was conducted on the hyperparameter λ, ranging from 0 to 10, to identify the optimal value that maximized performance on this validation set. The performance metric used was corr(CA, BA) – ∣corr(CA, BAI)∣, where corr(·) denotes Pearson’s correlation. This metric was chosen because correlation is normalized and comparable across different hyperparameter values, providing a clear indication of model performance.\n\nOnce the optimal hyperparameter was determined, the validation set was combined with the rest of the training set, and the model was retrained using this optimal value. This approach ensured that the final model was trained on the entire dataset, leveraging all available information.\n\nTo achieve statistically unbiased estimates of the model’s performance, strict separation was maintained between the training and testing participants. The dataset was partitioned into a healthy training set consisting of 1,343 participants and a testing set of 1,189 participants. The testing set included 167 individuals with significant neurological or psychiatric diseases and 1,022 healthy participants. The reported results are based on the performance of the model on this independent testing set, ensuring that the evaluation was conducted on data that the model had not seen during training.\n\nAdditionally, the study explored the effect of EEG electrode placement on age prediction performance. Different subsets of EEG electrodes were used to evaluate the model’s performance on 1,022 healthy testing participants. The results indicated that using all six electrodes (two frontal, two central, and two occipital) provided the lowest prediction error and the highest correlation with chronological age. However, if limited to two electrodes, the frontal electrodes offered the best performance with minimal difference compared to using all six electrodes.\n\nFurthermore, the longitudinal reliability of the brain age model was assessed using a subset of the SHHS dataset, where each participant underwent two study visits approximately five years apart. The model was trained in two ways: first, on participants with paired EEGs from both visits and tested on a held-out set; second, on the MGH dataset using the same EEG leads as SHHS and tested on the SHHS dataset. The results demonstrated that the model could longitudinally track brain aging with a marginal error of 0.2 to 0.9 years, indicating its robustness and reliability over time.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a specific set of performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our brain age prediction model. The primary metric used was the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the predicted brain age (BA) from the chronological age (CA). This metric provides a straightforward measure of the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual ages, giving insight into the model's accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, we reported the Pearson's correlation coefficient between CA and BA. This metric assesses the linear relationship between the predicted and actual ages, with higher values indicating better model performance. We also considered the absolute value of the correlation between CA and the brain age index (BAI), which helps in understanding the model's ability to predict deviations from the chronological age in an unbiased manner.\n\nTo determine the optimal hyperparameter λ, we used a performance metric that combines the correlation between CA and BA, and the absolute value of the correlation between CA and BAI. This metric is defined as corr(CA, BA) – |corr(CA, BAI)|, where corr(·) denotes Pearson’s correlation. A larger corr(CA, BA) and a smaller |corr(CA, BAI)| indicate better model performance. This approach ensures that the model not only predicts accurate ages but also handles deviations from the chronological age effectively.\n\nThese metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating brain age prediction models. The use of correlation, rather than covariance or prediction error, allows for a normalized and comparable evaluation across different hyperparameter values. This set of metrics provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, ensuring that it is both accurate and reliable in predicting brain age from EEG data.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our EEG-based brain age prediction model, we conducted a comparison between using sleep macro-structure features and sleep micro-structure EEG features. This comparison was performed on the testing set, which consisted of 1,189 participants from the MGH dataset.\n\nThe macro-structure features, which included 30 features related to sleep stage composition, were compared against 510 micro-structure EEG features. The results indicated that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of brain age (BA) from chronological age (CA) was significantly higher when using macro-structure features (23.3 years) compared to EEG features (7.8 years). Additionally, the correlation between predicted BA and CA was weaker with macro-structure features (0.46) than with EEG features (0.82).\n\nThis comparison suggests that the effects of age on brain activity are more consistently reflected in sleep EEG micro-structure than in sleep stage composition macro-structure. The progression of EEG features with age was further illustrated through a two-dimensional visualization of the feature space.\n\nWe did not perform a comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, the comparison to simpler baselines, in this case, macro-structure features, provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of using EEG features for brain age prediction.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance includes confidence intervals for the reported metrics. For instance, the Pearson's correlation between chronological age and brain age predicted using EEG features is reported with a 95% confidence interval. This provides a range within which the true correlation value is expected to lie, giving an indication of the precision of the estimate.\n\nStatistical significance is also considered in our evaluation. For example, when comparing the performance of different subsets of EEG electrodes, we use the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if the differences in mean absolute deviation (MAD) are statistically significant. Similarly, t-tests are employed to assess the significance of differences in the progression of chronological age and brain age over time.\n\nThese statistical tests help to ensure that the observed differences in performance are not due to random chance, thereby strengthening the claim that our method is superior to others and baselines. The use of confidence intervals and statistical tests enhances the reliability and validity of our findings, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.",
