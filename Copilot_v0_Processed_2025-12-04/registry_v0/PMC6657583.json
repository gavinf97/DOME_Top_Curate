  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from experiments involving TK6 cells exposed to 27 presumed aneugens. The initial testing consisted of exposing these cells to each chemical for 24 hours. Flow cytometric analyses were conducted at 4 and 24 hours, synthesizing the results into genotoxic potential and mode of action (MoA) predictions. These analyses identified all 27 test agents as genotoxic, with 25 predicted to be aneugenic, 1 exhibiting a mixed MoA, and 1 judged to be clastogenic.\n\nThe dataset includes area-under-the-curve (AUC) values for various biomarkers, which were calculated using Microsoft Excel via the trapezoidal rule. These biomarkers include 488 Taxol, p-H3, Ki-67, and p53, among others. The AUC data were used for clustering and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses. The clustering analysis was performed using JMP software (v12.0.1) and utilized hierarchical clustering methods.\n\nThe dataset comprises AUC values from each of the 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The ANN model was trained on these AUC values and evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This involved building 26 separate models, each with one chemical left out in turn, to approximate model performance on future, unseen datasets.\n\nThe dataset has been made available upon request, indicating that it can be used by the community for further analysis and validation. Additionally, the fold-increase data used to generate the machine learning ensemble are also available upon request. This ensures that the dataset is accessible for reproducibility and further research.",
  "dataset/splits": "There were 26 separate data splits, each corresponding to a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. In each split, one chemical was left out, and the model was trained on the remaining 25 chemicals. This process was repeated for each of the 26 chemicals identified as aneugens by the initial MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. Therefore, each split contained 25 data points, and the distribution of data points was consistent across all splits, with each split containing the AUC values from 25 chemicals.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in our study are available upon request. This includes the AUC data used for clustering and artificial neural network analyses. The data splits used for the machine learning model, specifically the training set data comprised of AUC values from each of the 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay, are also available upon request. The data are not publicly released in a forum but can be obtained by contacting the authors directly. The availability of the data is enforced through this request process, ensuring that interested parties can access the necessary information for replication or further analysis. The specific license terms for the data are not detailed, but standard academic practices for data sharing and collaboration would apply.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is an artificial neural network (ANN). This specific ANN was developed for classifying chemicals into one of four groups based on their molecular mechanisms of action. The groups include tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, and an indeterminate \"other\" category.\n\nThe ANN is not a novel algorithm in the sense that it is a well-established class of machine-learning models. However, the implementation and application of this ANN to classify chemicals based on their molecular mechanisms of action is specific to this study. The focus of this work is on the biological and toxicological implications rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. Therefore, it was published in a journal that aligns with the study's primary focus on bioassays and molecular mechanisms.\n\nThe ANN was trained using area-under-the-curve (AUC) values derived from biomarker responses. The training set consisted of AUC values from 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The model's performance was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, which involved building 26 separate models, each with one chemical left out. This method ensured that the model's predictions were robust and could be applied to future, unseen datasets.",
  "optimization/meta": "The optimization process for the model involved the use of a machine learning ensemble, which can be considered a form of meta-predictor. This ensemble integrated multiple machine learning algorithms to make genotoxic potential and mode of action predictions. Specifically, the ensemble included an artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) models. These models were used to classify chemicals based on their genotoxic properties, such as whether they were aneugenic or clastogenic.\n\nThe probabilities generated by each of these models for different concentrations of each chemical were plotted. For a chemical to be deemed aneugenic or clastogenic, specific criteria had to be met. For instance, two successive concentrations with a probability of at least 80%, or one concentration with a probability of at least 90%, was required for any single model to classify a chemical as aneugenic or clastogenic. Additionally, at least two of the models had to meet these criteria for an overall classification call.\n\nRegarding the independence of the training data, it is implied that the data used for training each of the individual models within the ensemble was independent. This is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the meta-predictor. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach further ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, enhancing the robustness of the predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, biomarker responses were converted to area under the curve (AUC) values. This conversion required feature scaling to normalize each test article concentration, bringing the values into a range of 0 to 1. This scaling was crucial for ensuring that the data was comparable across different concentrations and biomarkers.\n\nAdditionally, the ratio of p-H3-fold change to Ki-67-fold change was calculated for each concentration. These ratios were then graphed against normalized concentrations to generate AUC values for each chemical. This process was repeated for 488 Taxol-fold change values versus normalized concentrations. To set the baseline value to 0, 1 was subtracted from every biomarker’s fold-change value before AUC calculations were made. This adjustment ensured that AUC values were 0 or nearly so in the case of no response, positive in the case of an increase, and negative in the case of a reduction.\n\nThe AUC data, derived from these preprocessing steps, were then used for both unsupervised clustering and the development of the machine-learning prediction algorithm. The clustering analysis utilized hierarchical clustering with the Ward method for calculating distances between clusters, and the data was standardized before visualization as a dendrogram. For the machine-learning algorithm, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed using the AUC values from 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The ANN was designed to categorize chemicals into one of four groups: tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, or an indeterminate \"other\" group. The model was trained using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to evaluate its performance on future, unseen data sets.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized in this study employed two key input parameters. These parameters were chosen based on their relevance to the biological mechanisms being investigated. The first parameter was the 488 Taxol biomarker, which is indicative of tubulin binding activity. The second parameter was the p-H3:Ki-67 ratio, which is responsive to Aurora kinase B inhibition. These parameters were selected to capture the essential features of the chemicals' mechanisms of action, specifically their effects on tubulin dynamics and Aurora kinase activity. The choice of these parameters was informed by previous research and the need to differentiate between various molecular targets, such as tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, and Aurora kinase inhibitors. The model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation, ensuring that the selected parameters provided robust and reliable predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "The optimization process utilized two specific input features for the machine learning prediction algorithm. These features were the 488 Taxol fold-change values and the p-H3:Ki-67 ratio. Feature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process, suggesting that these two features were chosen based on their relevance to the biological mechanisms under study. The training set data comprised AUC values from each of the 26 aneugens identified by the initial MultiFlow DNA Damage assay, ensuring that the feature selection and model training were conducted using the same dataset. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the model's performance when applied to future, unseen data sets.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved an artificial neural network (ANN) designed to classify chemicals into one of four molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) groups. The ANN was trained using area-under-the-curve (AUC) values derived from biomarker responses, specifically the 488 Taxol and p-H3:Ki-67 ratio. The model utilized two factors and three hidden nodes, which is a relatively simple architecture given the complexity of the problem.\n\nThe number of parameters in the ANN is not excessively large compared to the number of training points. The training set consisted of AUC values from 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. This ensures that the model is not overly complex relative to the data available, which helps in mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo further rule out overfitting, a leave-one-out cross-validation approach was used. This method involves building 26 separate models, each time leaving out one chemical. Predictions were made for the left-out chemical, and the percentage of correctly classified chemicals was used to approximate model performance. This rigorous validation technique ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that the model had sufficient complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of an ANN with two factors and three hidden nodes provided a balance between model simplicity and capacity to learn from the data. Additionally, the choice of biomarkers and the transformation of data into AUC values helped in capturing the essential features of the chemical responses, ensuring that the model could learn meaningful patterns without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method employed in this study carefully balances model complexity and data availability. The use of leave-one-out cross-validation and a well-designed ANN architecture helps in ruling out both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring robust and generalizable model performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to prevent overfitting. This method involved building 26 separate models, each time leaving out one chemical from the training set. By doing this, we ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on data it had not seen during training, which helps in assessing its generalizability to new, unseen data. This technique is particularly useful in small datasets, as it maximizes the use of available data for both training and validation. Additionally, the use of an artificial neural network with a limited number of hidden nodes also helped in controlling the model complexity and preventing overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in the machine learning classification model are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed using JMP software (v12.0.1). The model was designed to categorize chemicals into one of four most likely aneugen molecular mechanism (AMM) groups: tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, or a catchall \"other\" group. The model was based on two factors: 488 Taxol and the p-H3:Ki-67 ratio, and it included three hidden nodes.\n\nThe training set data comprised AUC values from each of the 26 aneugens identified by the first tier MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The model was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, where 26 separate models were built, each with one chemical left out in turn. Classification predictions for each left-out chemical were made, and the resulting percentage of correctly classified chemicals was used to approximate model performance when applied to future, \"unseen\" data sets.\n\nThe AUC data used for clustering and ANN analyses are available upon request. This suggests that while the specific hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters are not publicly documented, the data and results used to train and validate the model can be accessed by requesting them from the authors. The availability of these data upon request implies that the configurations and parameters can be inferred or reconstructed by interested parties.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for the MultiFlow Aneugen Molecular Mechanism Assay is not a black box. It is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) designed to categorize chemicals into one of four most likely molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) groups: tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, or a catchall “other” (indeterminate) group. The model's transparency is evident in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the model's architecture is clearly defined. It is based on two factors: 488 Taxol and p-H3:Ki-67 ratio, and it includes three hidden nodes. This structure provides a clear understanding of the model's complexity and the interactions it considers.\n\nSecondly, the model's training and evaluation processes are well-documented. The training set data consisted of area-under-the-curve (AUC) values from each of the 26 aneugens identified by the first tier MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The model was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, where 26 separate models were built, each with one chemical left out in turn. This method provides a clear and rigorous way to assess the model's performance and generalizability.\n\nAdditionally, the model's predictions are interpretable. For each chemical, the model provides probabilities for each of the four MMOA groups. These probabilities offer insights into the model's decision-making process and the confidence it has in its predictions. For example, a chemical like Alisertib has a probability of 1 for being an Aurora kinase inhibitor, indicating a high confidence in this prediction. In contrast, a chemical like Aurora A inhibitor I has a more distributed probability across the groups, suggesting a less clear-cut prediction.\n\nFurthermore, the model's predictions can be visualized and compared across different chemicals. This allows for a better understanding of how the model differentiates between chemicals with different MMOAs. For instance, chemicals like 17b-Estradiol, Carbendazim, and Colchicine all have a probability of 1 for being tubulin destabilizers, highlighting a clear pattern in the model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, the model's architecture, training and evaluation processes, and interpretable predictions all contribute to its transparency. This transparency is crucial for understanding the model's behavior, assessing its reliability, and building trust in its predictions.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and is designed to categorize chemicals into one of four most likely groups: tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, or a catchall \"other\" (indeterminate) group. The model uses area under the curve (AUC) values derived from biomarker responses to make these classifications. The training set data consisted of AUC values from 26 aneugens identified by the MultiFlow DNA Damage assay. The model's performance was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, where 26 separate models were built, each with one chemical left out in turn. The classification predictions for each left-out chemical were made, and the percentage of correctly classified chemicals was used to approximate the model's performance when applied to future, unseen data sets. The model's output provides probabilities for each of the four categories for a given chemical, indicating the likelihood of the chemical belonging to each group.",

  "model/availability": "The source code for the machine learning prediction algorithm developed in this study is not publicly released. However, the software used for unsupervised clustering and the artificial neural network (ANN) model was JMP software (version 12.0.1). The AUC data used for clustering and ANN analyses are available upon request.

The specific details and methods for running the algorithm are not provided as an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance. For those interested in replicating or building upon the methods described, reaching out directly for the AUC data and further clarification on the procedures would be necessary.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the machine learning prediction algorithm involved a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This technique was employed to approximate the model's performance when applied to future, unseen datasets. Specifically, 26 separate models were constructed, each time leaving out one chemical from the training set. Predictions were then made for the left-out chemical, and the process was repeated for each chemical in the dataset. The percentage of correctly classified chemicals was used to assess the model's accuracy. This rigorous evaluation method ensures that the model's performance is robust and generalizable to new data.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the machine learning classification model was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This method involved building 26 separate models, each time leaving out one chemical to test. The model's predictions for the left-out chemical were then compared to its actual classification. The primary performance metric reported was the percentage of correctly classified chemicals. This metric provides an approximation of how well the model is expected to perform on future, unseen datasets. The leave-one-out cross-validation is a rigorous method that ensures each chemical is used as a test case exactly once, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's generalizability. This approach is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, particularly in the context of biological and chemical data analysis.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not directly compare our methods to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did perform a comparison to simpler baselines through the use of different machine learning models. Specifically, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) to classify chemicals based on their genotoxic potential and mechanism of action. The probabilities generated by these models were used to make predictions, with a requirement that two or more models must meet specific probability thresholds for an overall call.\n\nThe ANN model was designed to categorize chemicals into one of four groups: tubulin destabilizers, tubulin stabilizers, Aurora kinase B inhibitors, or an indeterminate \"other\" group. This model was trained using area-under-the-curve (AUC) values derived from biomarker responses and was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This method allowed us to assess the model's performance on \"unseen\" data, providing a robust evaluation of its predictive capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized unsupervised clustering to group chemicals based on their aneugenic or mixed activities. This clustering analysis helped to distinguish between tubulin binders and Aurora kinase inhibitors, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms at play. The clustering was performed using hierarchical methods and visualized through dendrograms, which aided in the interpretation of the data.\n\nWhile we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods, the use of multiple machine learning models and unsupervised clustering techniques provided a comprehensive evaluation of our approach. These methods allowed us to validate our predictions and gain a deeper understanding of the genotoxic potential and mechanisms of the chemicals studied.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the machine learning model, specifically the artificial neural network (ANN), included a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This method involved building 26 separate models, each time leaving out one chemical to assess its classification. The performance of the model was approximated by the percentage of correctly classified chemicals, providing a robust measure of its generalizability to new, unseen data sets.\n\nBenchmark dose (BMD) analyses were conducted using PROAST Web software, which provided benchmark dose lower limits (BMDL) and upper limits (BMDU) for each chemical. These confidence intervals are relatively narrow, indicating that the biomarker/time point combination used is suitable for point-of-departure-type analyses. The BMDL and BMDU values suggest that the model's predictions are reliable and statistically significant, as they provide a clear range within which the true benchmark dose is likely to fall.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results is further supported by the divergent potencies observed among the chemicals, particularly the tubulin binders. The wide range of potencies, spanning several orders of magnitude, highlights the model's ability to distinguish between highly potent and less potent aneugens. This variability in potency underscores the model's sensitivity and its capacity to make precise predictions about the genotoxic potential of different chemicals.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics, including the leave-one-out cross-validation and the narrow confidence intervals from the BMD analyses, indicate that the model is robust and reliable. The statistical significance of the results supports the claim that the method is superior to others and baselines, providing a strong foundation for its application in identifying the molecular mechanisms of aneugens.",
