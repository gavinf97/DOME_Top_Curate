  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study primarily consists of Illumina HumanMethylation450K array data. This data includes methylation levels quantified as beta values, which represent the ratio of the intensities of methylated and unmethylated alleles. Specifically, the dataset includes 307 cervical tumor samples and 3 associated normal tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\nIn addition to the TCGA data, methylation profiles from 113 normal samples were used as controls for differential methylation analysis.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a hybrid feature selection approach, which combines filter and wrapper methods. The filter method used is based on information gain, while the wrapper method utilizes sequential backward feature selection (SBFS). This hybrid approach was chosen to leverage the computational efficiency of filter methods and the accuracy of wrapper methods.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithm class used is logistic regression. This algorithm was selected for its effectiveness in binary classification problems, such as distinguishing between tumor and normal tissues.\n\nThe hybrid feature selection algorithm is not entirely new, as it builds upon established techniques in machine learning. The information gain filter method and the SBFS wrapper method have been previously used in various studies. However, the specific combination and application of these methods to identify cervical cancer-specific methylation markers are novel to this study.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of this research is on the biological and clinical implications of the identified methylation markers. The optimization algorithm is a means to an end, facilitating the discovery of reliable biomarkers for cervical cancer. The biological significance and potential clinical applications of these markers are the main contributions of this study.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, methylation data from various sources, including datasets like GSE38266, GSE46306, GSE68339_149, and GSE68339_121, were collected. These datasets included methylation profiles from both HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors, as well as normal cervical samples. RNA-seq expression profiles from cervical cancers were also obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\nConsensus clustering analysis was performed on the 591 most variable probes in CpG island (CGI) promoter regions using the K-means algorithm and Euclidean distance. To identify the most variable CpGs, those with a standard deviation for the β value larger than 0.2 were selected, and CpGs with an average methylation level in normal tissues larger than 0.05 were removed.\n\nDifferential methylation analysis was conducted between normal and tumor samples, excluding probes containing SNPs, probes in chromosome X, and probes with more than 10% missing values. Missing values were imputed using the imputeTS R package, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs). DMCs were reported if the mean methylation difference was greater than 0.2 with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.\n\nDifferential expression analysis was performed on 69 normal and 304 tumor samples with RNA-seq expression profiles. Raw read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using a negative binomial generalized log-linear model. DEGs were reported if the log-fold change was greater than 1.5 and the adjusted p-value was smaller than 0.05.\n\nFunctional annotation clustering analysis was conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The top five gene ontology (GO) biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were reported with their p-values and Benjamini–Hochberg values.\n\nFor feature selection, a hybrid approach was employed. First, the information gain of all candidate CpGs was calculated, and CpGs with an information gain greater than 0.3 were selected. Sequential backward feature selection (SBFS) was then used to generate different combinations of CpGs, which were evaluated using a logistic regression model. The subset with the highest classification accuracy was selected as the final subset.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we identified four specific methylation markers that were used as input parameters for our model. These markers are cg07211381, cg12205729, cg20708961, and cg26490054, which are associated with the genes RAB3C, GABRA2, ZNF257, and SLC5A8, respectively. The selection of these markers was based on a hybrid feature selection approach that combined information gain and sequential backward feature selection (SBFS). This method allowed us to filter out irrelevant markers and identify the most informative subset for distinguishing cervical tumors from normal tissues. The chosen markers demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, making them reliable for the classification task.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a hybrid feature selection approach to identify the most informative subset of features for distinguishing cervical tumors from normal tissues. The initial dataset consisted of high-dimensional Illumina HumanMethylation450K data, which includes measurements for approximately 450,000 CpG sites. Given the impracticality of using all these features due to computational costs and the risk of overfitting, we employed a hybrid method that combines filter and wrapper techniques.\n\nThe feature selection process began with a filter method based on information gain. We calculated the information gain for each CpG site and ranked them accordingly. CpGs with an information gain greater than 0.3 were selected for further processing. This step significantly reduced the dimensionality of the data by eliminating irrelevant CpGs.\n\nFollowing the filter method, we applied a wrapper method known as sequential backward feature selection (SBFS). This involved generating different combinations of the remaining CpGs and evaluating them using a logistic regression model. The subset of CpGs that achieved the highest classification accuracy was selected as the final feature set.\n\nThe final subset consisted of four methylation markers: cg07211381 (RAB3C), cg12205729 (GABRA2), cg20708961 (ZNF257), and cg26490054 (SLC5A8). These markers were identified using the training set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and were validated on independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.\n\nThe feature selection process ensured that the input features used in our model were both informative and computationally efficient, leading to high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing cervical tumors from normal tissues.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a hybrid feature selection approach to identify the most informative CpG markers for distinguishing cervical cancer from normal tissues. This approach initially involved calculating the information gain for all candidate CpGs, which helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data by eliminating irrelevant features. A threshold of information gain greater than 0.3 was set to select CpGs for further processing, ensuring that only the most relevant features were considered.\n\nFollowing this filter method, we used sequential backward feature selection (SBFS) to further refine the subset of CpGs. This wrapper method involved generating different combinations of CpGs and evaluating them using a logistic regression model. The subset with the highest classification accuracy was selected as the final subset, which included four cervical cancer-specific markers: cg07211381, cg12205729, cg20708961, and cg26490054.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we performed tenfold cross-validation on the training set. This technique involved randomly dividing the data into ten different sets, using nine sets for training and the remaining set for validation. This process was repeated ten times, ensuring that each set was used once as the validation set. The area under the curve (AUC) of 0.989 indicated that the model achieved excellent performance in distinguishing cervical cancer samples from normal samples, suggesting that overfitting was effectively ruled out.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was validated on independent datasets (GSE38266, GSE46306, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149), where it demonstrated high classification accuracy. The true-positive rates, false-positive rates, precision, F-measure, and AUC were summarized for these validation sets, confirming the robustness of the model and ruling out underfitting. The consistent performance across different datasets further supports the reliability of the identified markers and the effectiveness of the hybrid feature selection approach in preventing both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a hybrid feature selection approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of our model. This method combines the strengths of both filter and wrapper techniques. Initially, we used information gain as a filter to rank and select relevant CpG sites based on their ability to discriminate between cervical tumors and normal tissues. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and eliminating irrelevant features, which is crucial for preventing overfitting.\n\nFollowing the filter step, we applied sequential backward feature selection (SBFS) as a wrapper method. SBFS systematically removes features and evaluates the performance of the remaining subset using a logistic regression model. This iterative process ensures that the final subset of features not only retains the most informative CpGs but also generalizes well to unseen data. By integrating both filter and wrapper methods, our hybrid approach effectively balances computational efficiency and model accuracy, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a hybrid feature selection approach that combines information gain and sequential backward feature selection (SBFS) to identify the most informative subset of features (CpGs) for distinguishing cervical tumors from normal tissues. This approach first ranks CpGs based on their information gain, which measures the reduction in entropy or uncertainty about the class labels (tumor or normal) after observing the CpG. CpGs with an information gain greater than 0.3 are selected for further processing. Then, SBFS is used to generate different combinations of these selected CpGs and evaluate them using a logistic regression model. The subset of CpGs that achieves the highest classification accuracy is chosen as the final subset.\n\nThis hybrid approach provides transparency by clearly showing how each CpG contributes to the model's predictions. The information gain metric indicates the importance of each CpG in discriminating between tumor and normal tissues. Additionally, the logistic regression model used for evaluation is interpretable, as it provides coefficients for each selected CpG, indicating their direction and magnitude of effect on the predicted probability of a sample being a tumor.\n\nFurthermore, the study identifies four specific CpGs (cg07211381, cg12205729, cg20708961, and cg26490054) mapped to four different genes (RAB3C, GABRA2, ZNF257, and SLC5A8) as cervical cancer-specific markers. The distribution of methylation levels of these markers in cervical tumors, normal tissues, and other cancers demonstrates their specificity to cervical cancer. This transparency allows for a clear understanding of the biological relevance of the identified markers and their potential use in clinical applications.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized logistic regression to distinguish between cervical cancer tumors and normal tissues. The model was trained using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and validated on several independent datasets, including GSE38266, GSE46306, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the true-positive rate, false-positive rate, precision, F-measure, and the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC for the model trained on TCGA samples was 0.989, indicating excellent performance in differentiating between cervical cancer and normal samples. Additionally, the model demonstrated high classification accuracy and AUC values when compared to previously published cervical cancer-specific methylation markers.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure the reliability and performance of the identified cervical cancer-specific methylation markers. Initially, a logistic regression model was built using samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as the training set. To achieve a reliable predictive measurement, tenfold cross-validation was performed. This process involved randomly dividing the data into ten different sets, using nine sets for training and the remaining set for validation. The area under the curve (AUC) from this cross-validation was 0.989, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing cervical cancer samples from normal samples.\n\nTo further validate the markers, the model was tested on independent datasets, specifically GSE38266, GSE46306, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149. The performance was summarized in terms of true-positive (TP) rate, false-positive (FP) rate, precision, F-measure, and AUC. The markers successfully classified tumors from controls in GSE38266, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149. However, the true-positive rate for GSE46306 was lower due to the limited number of tumor samples, which made it challenging to determine accurate decision boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, the four identified markers were compared with known cervical cancer-specific markers in terms of classification accuracy and AUC. Logistic regression models were trained using CpGs from previous studies, and the classification performances were found to be comparable. The four markers identified in this study demonstrated better performance for most validation datasets.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was also conducted to investigate the expression of the identified markers in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) specimens. Tissue arrays containing 93 human CSCC samples and paired cancer-adjacent normal tissues were used. The protein levels of GABRA2, ZNF257, SLC5A8, and RAB3C were assessed, and significantly lower levels of staining for GABRA2, ZNF257, and SLC5A8 were found in CSCC cells compared to normal cells. This suggested that the hypermethylation of these genes was correlated with decreased expression in human CSCC cells.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of our cervical cancer-specific methylation markers using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include the true-positive (TP) rate, false-positive (FP) rate, precision, F-measure, and the area under the curve (AUC). These metrics were chosen because they provide a well-rounded view of the model's ability to correctly identify tumors and normal tissues, as well as its efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe TP rate indicates the proportion of actual tumor samples correctly identified by the model, while the FP rate shows the proportion of normal samples incorrectly classified as tumors. Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model, and the F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. The AUC, derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, offers a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between tumor and normal samples across all classification thresholds.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of classification models in biomedical research, making our set of metrics representative and comparable to other studies in the field. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a clear and transparent evaluation of our model's performance, allowing for meaningful comparisons with other cervical cancer-specific methylation markers and classification methods.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our identified methylation markers with previously published cervical cancer-specific methylation markers. This comparison was performed on several benchmark datasets, including TCGA, GSE46306, GSE38266, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149. We evaluated the performance of these markers using logistic regression models and assessed them based on metrics such as true-positive (TP) rate, false-positive (FP) rate, precision, F-measure, and the area under the curve (AUC).\n\nFor the comparison, we trained logistic regression models using different sets of CpGs mapped to various genes as identified by previous studies. Specifically, we used 11 CpGs mapped to NOL4 and LHFPL4 according to Wang et al., 6 CpGs mapped to GHSR, SST, and ZIC1 according to Verlaat et al., 60 CpGs mapped to SOX1, PAX1, LMX1A, NKX6-1, WT1, and ONECUT1 according to Lai et al., and 37 CpGs mapped to DCC, EPB41L3, and SOX1 according to Clarke et al.\n\nThe results of this comparison are summarized in Table 2, which shows the AUCs and classification accuracies for the different marker sets. Our study's markers demonstrated better performance for most validation datasets, indicating their robustness and specificity for cervical cancer detection.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our markers with simpler baselines by evaluating their performance on datasets with varying numbers of tumor samples. For instance, the true-positive rate for GSE46306 was relatively lower due to the limited number of tumor samples, highlighting the importance of sufficient data for accurate classification. This comparison underscores the effectiveness of our markers in distinguishing cervical tumors from normal tissues, even when compared to established markers and simpler baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes several key aspects that contribute to the confidence in our results. We employed a logistic regression model and used tenfold cross-validation to ensure reliable predictive measurements. The area under the curve (AUC) for the training set was 0.989, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing cervical cancer samples from normal samples.\n\nFor the validation sets, we summarized the classification performance using metrics such as the true-positive (TP) rate, false-positive (FP) rate, precision, F-measure, and AUC. The four identified markers (cg07211381, cg12205729, cg20708961, and cg26490054) demonstrated perfect classification for datasets GSE38266, GSE68339_121, and GSE68339_149. However, the true-positive rate for GSE46306 was relatively lower due to the limited number of tumor samples, which made it challenging to determine accurate decision boundaries.\n\nTo further validate our markers, we compared them with known cervical cancer-specific markers in terms of classification accuracy and AUC. The performance of our markers was comparable and, in many cases, superior to previously published markers. This comparison included markers from studies by Wang et al., Verlaat et al., Lai et al., and Clarke et al.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using adjusted p-values and correlation coefficients. For example, a significant correlation was defined as a correlation coefficient (r) greater than 0.3 and an adjusted p-value less than 0.05. These thresholds ensured that the correlations observed between methylation levels and gene expression were statistically significant.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics were rigorously evaluated using cross-validation and statistical significance tests. The results demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the identified markers in distinguishing cervical cancer samples from normal tissues.",
