  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method, which is a kernel-based approach used to evaluate the difference in gene expression levels between various sample types. This method is rooted in statistical learning theory and is particularly effective in distinguishing between distributions, making it suitable for identifying differentially expressed genes.\n\nThe MMD method is not entirely new but has been adapted and optimized for our specific application in gene expression analysis. The choice to publish this work in a genomics journal rather than a machine-learning journal is driven by the focus on the biological significance and practical applications of the findings. The primary goal of our research is to improve the identification of marker genes for lung cancer, which is a critical area of study in medical genomics. While the MMD method has a strong foundation in machine learning, its application and optimization for gene expression analysis are novel contributions to the field of medical genomics.\n\nThe MMD method involves calculating the distance between the means of two distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This approach allows for a robust evaluation of gene expression differences, even when the distributions are complex. The computational complexity of the MMD method is O(n^2), which is manageable for the datasets used in our study. The method has been implemented using the Shogun package in Python, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in our analyses.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to identify marker genes for lung cancer. This meta-predictor leverages the outputs of multiple machine learning methods to enhance the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Specifically, we compared our proposed kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method with two conventional differentially expressed analysis (DEA) methods: t-test and fold change.\n\nThe kernel MMD method is designed to detect DEGs between tumor, normal adjacent tumor (NAT), and normal tissues without relying on a specific statistical hypothesis about data distribution. This method provides a maximum mean discrepancy score that indicates the degree of differential expression.\n\nThe t-test and fold change methods are widely used in gene expression analysis. The t-test evaluates the statistical significance of gene expression differences between two groups, while the fold change method measures the ratio of gene expression levels between two conditions. Both methods were implemented using established packages: the t-test with the Python package 'Scipy' and the fold change calculated using the formula provided.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our meta-predictor, we conducted a 10-fold cross-validation using a random forest classifier. This validation process evaluated the performance of the top-ranked genes selected by each method under four metrics: recall, F1 score, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The results demonstrated that the kernel MMD method outperformed the t-test and fold change methods across all metrics, indicating its superior ability to classify tumor samples from other samples.\n\nThe training data for each method was independent, ensuring that the comparisons were fair and unbiased. The top-ranked genes from each method were then used to identify potential marker genes for lung cancer. The expression boundaries of these genes were further analyzed using information gain theory, providing a comprehensive approach to gene marker identification.\n\nIn summary, our meta-predictor integrates the strengths of multiple machine learning methods to improve the identification of lung cancer marker genes. The kernel MMD method, in particular, showed superior performance, highlighting its potential for practical applications in differential gene analysis.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we utilized three gene expression datasets containing data from normal, normal adjacent to tumor (NAT), and tumor tissues. These datasets included expression data for 23,368 genes. The first dataset comprised 373 normal healthy samples obtained from the GTEx program. The second dataset consisted of 59 NAT tissues, and the third dataset included 541 lung cancer tumor tissues.\n\nTo evaluate the differential expression of genes, we employed the kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) method. This approach does not require a statistical hypothesis on data distribution, making it robust for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the different tissue types. The kernel MMD method outputs a maximum mean discrepancy score, which indicates the degree of differential expression.\n\nAdditionally, we applied information theory to address the challenge of defining a threshold for gene expression levels. This method helps in identifying reliable boundaries for gene expression, which is crucial for distinguishing between normal and tumor tissues. The information gain, calculated using entropy, evaluates the classification efficiency of threshold points. By sorting the expression level values and calculating the information gain for each split point, we identified the boundary with the highest information gain.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithm, the data was pre-processed by evaluating the expression level difference of all 23,368 genes using the kernel MMD method. The top-ranked genes selected by this method were then compared with genes identified by conventional differentially expressed analysis (DEA) methods, such as t-test and fold change. This comparison ensured that our selected genes were robust and reliable for further analysis.\n\nThe top 100 genes, ranked by average MMD scores, underwent Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. This analysis provided insights into the molecular functions and biological pathways associated with the selected genes. Finally, the top 10 genes were chosen as marker genes for lung cancer, and their expression boundaries between normal, NAT, and tumor tissues were identified using the proposed information theory method.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the primary parameter used in the model is the kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) score, which evaluates the gene expression difference between different sample types. The MMD score is calculated using a Gaussian kernel, and its value indicates the degree of differential expression without requiring a statistical hypothesis on data distribution.\n\nThe selection of the MMD method was driven by its ability to handle continuous gene expression data and its effectiveness in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor, normal adjacent tumor (NAT), and normal tissues. This approach does not rely on predefined thresholds or distribution assumptions, making it robust for various datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the information entropy method was applied to solve the problem of defining expression boundaries, which is crucial for identifying marker genes. This method helps in determining reliable thresholds for gene expression levels, even when distinct gaps are not present.\n\nThe top genes selected by the MMD method were further validated through 10-fold cross-validation, demonstrating high performance metrics such as recall, F1 score, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). This validation process ensured that the selected genes were effective in classifying tumor samples from other samples.\n\nIn summary, the model utilizes the MMD score as the primary parameter, selected for its robustness and effectiveness in differential gene analysis. The information entropy method complements this by providing a reliable way to define expression boundaries, enhancing the overall accuracy and applicability of the identified marker genes.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized gene expression data from 23,368 genes as input features. These genes were evaluated across three different tissue types: normal healthy samples, normal adjacent tumor (NAT) tissues, and lung cancer tumor tissues. The kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) method was employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these tissue types.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most significant genes. The top-ranked genes, based on their MMD scores, were selected for further analysis. This selection process involved comparing the genes identified by the kernel MMD method with those identified by conventional differentially expressed analysis (DEA) methods, such as t-test and fold change. The top 10 genes from each group were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation to assess their effectiveness in classifying tumor samples from other samples.\n\nThe feature selection process ensured that the genes chosen were the most relevant for distinguishing between the different tissue types. This was crucial for the subsequent analysis, including the identification of marker genes for lung cancer and the enrichment analysis of gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The selected genes demonstrated high accuracy, recall, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) in the cross-validation, indicating their robustness as biomarkers for lung cancer.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we used a kernel-based approach with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This method involves setting the function class as the unit ball in a universal RKHS, which helps to control the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting. By doing so, we ensure that the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) metric, which evaluates the gene expression difference between different sample types, is computed in a way that balances model complexity and performance. This regularization technique is integral to our method, as it allows us to identify significant genes for lung cancer diagnosis while maintaining the robustness and generalizability of our model.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black-box but rather a transparent approach that leverages well-established statistical and information-theoretic methods. One of the key aspects of our model's transparency is the use of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) score to evaluate gene expression differences between various sample types. The MMD score provides a clear and interpretable metric, where a higher score indicates a greater difference in gene expression levels. This method is grounded in kernel methods and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, making it both mathematically rigorous and interpretable.\n\nAdditionally, the boundary discovery method used in our model is based on information theory, specifically the concept of information gain. This approach is widely used in decision tree algorithms and is well-understood in the context of classification problems. By sorting expression level values and calculating the information gain at each split point, we can identify the most informative threshold for distinguishing between normal and tumor samples. This process is detailed in the supplementary materials, providing a clear and reproducible method for threshold identification.\n\nThe use of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis further enhances the interpretability of our model. These methods provide a functional annotation of the genes, describing their roles at a molecular level and mapping them to known biological pathways. This not only helps in understanding the biological significance of the identified genes but also makes the model's outputs more interpretable and actionable.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is ensured through the use of interpretable statistical methods, clear threshold identification processes, and comprehensive functional annotation of genes. These elements together make the model's decisions and outputs understandable and verifiable.",

The classification is performed using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. The top-ranked differentially expressed genes are selected and their expression data is applied to classify the samples. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, with the top average ranked genes achieving the best scores under all metrics.

These methods are widely used in the field and served as robust baselines for our evaluation.\n\nWe applied these methods to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different tissue types, including normal, normal adjacent to tumor (NAT), and tumor tissues. The t-test and fold change methods were implemented using established packages, 'Scipy' for t-test and a custom calculation for fold change. The p-value for t-test and fold change value were calculated to evaluate the gene expression difference.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we used the same strategy to rank genes based on their scores from each method.
