  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is the random forest method. This is a well-established machine learning technique that utilizes multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is built using a random subset of the data and features, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness.\n\nThe random forest method is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including bioinformatics and medical research. The decision to use this method was driven by its proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and its ability to identify important features that contribute to the outcome of interest.\n\nGiven that random forests are a widely recognized and trusted algorithm, there was no need to publish this specific application in a machine-learning journal. The focus of this study is on the biological and clinical implications of the findings, rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. The random forest method was chosen for its practical advantages in analyzing the data and deriving meaningful insights into the immune microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is a meta-predictor that leverages data from various machine-learning algorithms as input. Specifically, it utilizes the random forest method, which is based on multiple random-built decision trees. This approach allows for the integration of a wide range of input parameters, including the relative infiltration of 28 types of immune cells, somatic mutation counts, 78 immune-related molecules, and 50 signaling pathways from the HALLMARK collection.\n\nThe random forest method is particularly effective in this context because it can handle a large number of input variables and identify the most determining features in forming local cytolytic activity (CYT). The importance score derived from the machine learning process represents the relative contribution of each factor to the resulting immune response. This score helps in understanding which factors are crucial in determining the immune response in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the model, the study employed the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm to visualize the proximity of samples, indicating their similarity in immunophenotype. Additionally, out-of-bag samples were used to support a rational and acceptable error rate for the decision trees, thereby avoiding artificial bias.\n\nThe independence of the training data is crucial for the validity of the meta-predictor. While the specific details of data independence are not explicitly stated, the use of out-of-bag samples and the MDS algorithm suggests a rigorous approach to ensuring that the training data is independent and that the model's predictions are reliable. This independence is essential for the model to accurately classify tumors according to CYT and to identify patients who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.",

These included the relative infiltration levels of 28 different types of immune cells, which were estimated using the ssGSEA method. This bioinformatics approach translates transcriptomic expression data into normalized scores, representing the relative abundance of specific cell types.\n\nAdditionally, somatic mutation counts were incorporated, providing insights into the genetic alterations present in the tumors. A total of 78 immune-related molecules were also considered, capturing a broad spectrum of immune activities and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, 50 signaling pathways from the HALLMARK collection were included, offering a detailed view of the molecular pathways active in the tumors.\n\nAll these parameters were used to assess cytolytic activity (CYT), a measure of the immune system's ability to kill cancer cells.

The selection of these parameters was based on their potential relevance to the immune response and their availability in the dataset. The importance score derived from the machine learning process was used to determine the relative contribution of each factor to the resulting immune response. This score helped identify the most determining features in forming local CYT, which included several effector molecules and key transcription factors in the Th1/CTL response. The use of a large number of parameters allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing CYT, but it also required dimensionality reduction techniques, such as the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm, to visualize the proximity of samples and their similarity in immunophenotype.",

  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a random forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique based on multiple decision trees. The number of parameters used was indeed large, totaling 782, which included various factors such as the relative infiltration of 28 types of immune cells, somatic mutation counts, 78 immune-related molecules, and 50 signaling pathways.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, given the high dimensionality of the input parameters relative to the number of training points, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the random forest method inherently reduces over-fitting by averaging the results of multiple decision trees, each built using a random subset of the data and features. This ensemble approach helps to mitigate the risk of the model becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the training data.\n\nAdditionally, the out-of-bag (OOB) samples were used to support a rational and acceptable error rate for the decision trees. OOB samples are the portions of the data that were not used in the construction of a particular tree but can be used to estimate the generalization error of the model. This technique provides an internal estimate of the model's performance and helps to ensure that the model is not over-fitting the training data.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the importance score derived from the machine learning process was used to identify the most determining features in forming local cytolytic activity (CYT). This score represented the relative contribution of each factor to the resulting immune response, ensuring that the model captured the essential variables influencing the outcome. Furthermore, the use of a comprehensive set of input parameters, including a wide range of immune-related molecules and signaling pathways, helped to ensure that the model was sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nThe dimensionality-reduced visualization using the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm also aided in assessing the model's performance. By illustrating the proximity of samples, the MDS algorithm provided insights into the similarity of immunological statuses between patients, further validating the model's ability to capture relevant patterns in the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we used the random forest algorithm, which inherently includes regularization techniques. Random forests are an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This approach helps to reduce overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees, which tend to correct for the errors made by any single tree.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the out-of-bag (OOB) samples to estimate the error rate of the random forest model. OOB samples are the portions of the data that were not used in the construction of a particular tree. By evaluating the model on these OOB samples, we could assess the model's performance and ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nThese techniques collectively helped us to build a robust model that is less likely to overfit the training data, thereby improving the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a blackbox. We utilized a machine learning method called random forests, which is inherently interpretable. This method comprises multiple decision trees, each contributing to the final prediction. The interpretability of our model is enhanced by the use of importance scores, which quantify the relative contribution of each input parameter to the resulting immune response. This allows us to identify the most determining features in forming local cytolytic activity (CYT).\n\nFor instance, several effector molecules and key transcription factors in the Th1/CTL response were found to be significant contributors. This finding aligns with established knowledge on antitumor immunity, demonstrating the model's ability to provide transparent and interpretable results. Additionally, we introduced gene panels, such as those involving immune cell enrichment, activation, and checkpoint molecules, to further characterize immunological statuses and ICI-responsive potential. The expression levels of these genes in immunologically hot versus cold patients with TNBC supported the model's predictions, reinforcing its transparency and reliability.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. Specifically, the random forest method was used to classify tumors of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to their cytolytic activity (CYT). Random forests are an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. This approach was utilized to determine the importance of various parameters in assessing CYT, which in turn helps in categorizing the immunological status of patients with TNBC. The model's output includes the classification of patients into distinct immunological statuses, which are crucial for predicting their potential response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Additionally, the model's dimensionality-reduced visualization using the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm aids in illustrating the similarity in immunophenotypes among samples.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific analyses performed. The calculation of cytolytic activity (CYT) involved processing RNA-sequencing data to determine the geometric mean of perforin-1 (PRF1) and granzyme-A (GZMA) expression. This process was conducted using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and required log2 transformation and normalization, which were handled using R and RStudio. The time taken for these computations was influenced by the size of the dataset and the computational resources available.\n\nAdditionally, the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to evaluate immune signatures in the tumor microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involved identifying gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database. This analysis required the computation of ssGSEA scores using the R package ‘Gene Set Variation Analysis,’ which also contributed to the overall execution time.\n\nThe random forest method, used to classify tumors based on CYT, involved building multiple decision trees with hundreds of input parameters. This machine learning approach required significant computational resources and time to assess the importance scores of various factors contributing to CYT. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm was then used for dimensionality-reduced visualization, further adding to the execution time.\n\nOverall, the execution time for the model was substantial due to the complexity of the analyses and the large volume of data processed.
