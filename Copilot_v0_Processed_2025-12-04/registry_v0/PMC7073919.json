  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was generated from urine samples of 149 patients with prostate cancer. The miRNA profiling was performed using the nCounter Human v.2 miRNA Expression Assay from NanoString Technologies. The patients were divided into three cohorts: a discovery cohort of 10 patients, a training cohort of 99 patients, and a validation cohort of 40 patients. The discovery cohort was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of miRNA abundance and to select intrastable miRNAs. The training cohort, composed of 50 high-risk and 49 low-risk patients, was used to build a predictive model to identify aggressive prostate cancer. The validation cohort, with 11 high-risk and 29 low-risk patients, was used to evaluate the prediction performance of the model.\n\nThe raw data from this study have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE86474). This dataset includes the miRNA abundances quantified using NanoString nCounter technology and normalized using NanoStringNorm. The dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as it is a novel study focusing on the temporal stability and prognostic biomarker potential of the prostate cancer urine miRNA transcriptome. The dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles in urine samples, which can be useful for developing noninvasive biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.",
  "dataset/splits": "Three data splits were used in the study. The discovery cohort consisted of 10 patients, with two to three urine samples collected from each patient. This cohort was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of individual miRNA abundance and select intrastable miRNAs.\n\nThe training cohort was composed of 99 patients, with 50 high-risk (GS > 7) and 49 low-risk patients (GS = 6). This cohort was used to build a predictive model to identify aggressive prostate cancer. Intrastable miRNAs were used as features to build the model.\n\nThe validation cohort, which was composed of 40 patients, with 11 high-risk and 29 low-risk patients, was used for further evaluation of the prediction performance of the model. The distribution of data points in each data split was designed to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance across different stages of development and validation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into three distinct cohorts to ensure independence and robustness in the analysis. The discovery cohort consisted of 10 patients and was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of miRNA abundance, as well as to select intrastable miRNAs. This cohort was crucial for understanding the baseline variability and stability of miRNAs within and between individuals.\n\nThe training cohort, comprising 99 patients, was split into 50 high-risk (Gleason Score > 7) and 49 low-risk patients (Gleason Score = 6). This cohort was utilized to build a predictive model aimed at identifying aggressive prostate cancer. The model was constructed using intrastable miRNAs as features, ensuring that the selected miRNAs were temporally stable within individuals.\n\nThe validation cohort, which included 40 patients (11 high-risk and 29 low-risk), was used for further evaluation of the prediction performance of the model. This cohort was entirely independent of the training cohort, ensuring that the model's performance could be assessed on unseen data. The miRNA abundances for all three cohorts were quantified separately using NanoString nCounter technology and normalized using NanoStringNorm.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets aligns with the goal of developing a robust predictive model for prostate cancer risk stratification. The use of independent cohorts for discovery, training, and validation ensures that the model's performance is not overfitted to a specific dataset and can generalize well to new, unseen data. This approach is consistent with best practices in machine learning and biomarker development, emphasizing the importance of independent validation to confirm the model's reliability and accuracy.",
  "dataset/availability": "The raw data generated from our study has been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The specific accession number for our dataset is GSE86474. This public repository allows researchers to access and download the data for further analysis or validation of our findings.\n\nThe data includes the miRNA profiles from urine samples of 149 patients, divided into three cohorts: a discovery cohort of 10 patients, a training cohort of 99 patients, and a validation cohort of 40 patients. The data splits used in our study are clearly defined within the dataset, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.\n\nThe GEO database operates under the terms of the NCBI Data Sharing Policy, which allows for the free use of the data for research purposes, subject to proper citation and acknowledgment of the original study.

This includes acknowledging the original study and citing it in any publications that result from the use of the data. Additionally, the database provides guidelines for data citation and acknowledgment, ensuring that the contributions of the original researchers are recognized.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is a random forest model. This is a well-established ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\nThe algorithm is not new. Random forests have been widely used and studied in the machine-learning community for many years. They are known for their robustness, ability to handle large datasets, and resistance to overfitting.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of the study is on the application of machine learning to a specific biomedical problem, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. The study aims to leverage existing machine-learning techniques to create a novel biomarker for prostate cancer, utilizing temporally stable miRNAs identified from urine samples. The innovation lies in the application and validation of these techniques in a clinical context, rather than in the development of new algorithmic methods.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication is a machine-learning-based predictive model designed to classify prostate cancer risk groups into high-risk and low-risk categories. It is not explicitly stated as a meta-predictor, but it does involve multiple steps and techniques that contribute to its final form.\n\nThe process begins with the identification of intrastable miRNAs from a discovery cohort of 10 patients. These miRNAs are selected based on their temporal stability within individuals. The next step involves training a model using a larger cohort of 99 patients, which includes both high-risk and low-risk cases. This training cohort is used to build a predictive model using feature selection and a random forest algorithm. The model is then validated on an independent cohort of 40 patients to evaluate its reliability and performance.\n\nThe random forest model is the primary machine-learning method used in this process. It is trained using the top-ranked intrastable miRNAs identified from the discovery cohort. The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which indicates its ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients.\n\nThe training data for the model is derived from an independent cohort of 99 patients, ensuring that the training and validation datasets are separate. This independence is crucial for evaluating the model's generalizability and performance in real-world scenarios. The validation cohort, consisting of 40 patients, is used to further test the model's accuracy and reliability, providing an additional layer of validation.\n\nIn summary, while the model is not explicitly described as a meta-predictor, it integrates multiple steps and machine-learning techniques to create a robust predictive model for prostate cancer risk stratification. The use of an independent training cohort and a separate validation cohort ensures the integrity and reliability of the model's performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, miRNA profiling was conducted using the nCounter Human v.2 miRNA Expression Assay. Urine miRNA profiles were generated from three patient cohorts: a discovery cohort of 10 patients, a training cohort of 99 patients, and a validation cohort of 40 patients. The miRNA abundances from these cohorts were quantified using NanoString nCounter technology and normalized using the NanoStringNorm package.\n\nThe discovery cohort was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of individual miRNA abundance and to select intrastable miRNAs. These intrastable miRNAs were then used as features to build the predictive model. The training cohort, composed of high-risk and low-risk patients, was used to build the model, while the validation cohort was used to evaluate its performance.\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out in the R programming language. Unpaired two-sided Student t-tests with Welch’s adjustment and the two-sided Wilcoxon test were used for two-group comparisons. To measure intra- and interindividual variances, linear mixed-effects regression was employed, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to represent the proportion of interindividual variance relative to total variance. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the ConsensusClusterPlus package, and feature selection and predictor generation were done using a random forest model. The final model comprised seven intrastable miRNAs and was validated in an independent cohort to ensure its reliability.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters used in the model was determined through a feature selection process. Initially, miRNAs with high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were identified from a discovery cohort of 10 patients. These intrastable miRNAs were then used as features to build a predictive model. The final model comprised seven intrastable miRNAs. The selection of these miRNAs was performed using a random forest algorithm with hyperparameter optimization in the training cohort, which consisted of 99 patients. The top-ranked miRNAs based on their importance in the random forest model were selected to build the final predictive model. This approach ensured that the most relevant and stable miRNAs were included in the model, optimizing its performance in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer patients.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the predictive model are intrastable miRNAs. These miRNAs were selected based on their temporal stability within individual patients. The discovery cohort, consisting of 10 patients, was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of individual miRNA abundance and to select these intrastable miRNAs.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training cohort, which included 99 patients. This cohort was composed of 50 high-risk and 49 low-risk patients. The feature selection process involved fivefold cross-validation repeated 10 times to measure miRNA importance. The top-ranked miRNAs from this process were used to build the predictive model.\n\nThe final model comprised seven intrastable miRNAs: miR-3195, let-7b-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-451a, miR-148a-3p, miR-512-5p, and miR-431-5p. These miRNAs were selected from the training cohort and were used as features to build the random forest model. The model's performance was then evaluated in an independent validation cohort of 40 patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study utilized a random forest model for the predictive analysis, which inherently helps to mitigate overfitting due to its ensemble nature. The model was built using a training cohort of 99 patients, which included 50 high-risk and 49 low-risk individuals. To ensure the robustness of the model, fivefold cross-validation was performed 10 times. This cross-validation process helps to assess the model's performance and generalizability by training on different subsets of the data and validating on the remaining portions.\n\nTo further validate the model, an independent validation cohort of 40 patients was used. This cohort was not involved in the training process, providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the validation cohort was 0.74, which is comparable to the performance in the training cohort, indicating that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of intraindividual temporal stability for biomarkers was quantified by generating a signature from intravariable miRNAs. The prediction accuracy significantly decreased when intravariable miRNAs were used, highlighting the importance of selecting intrastable miRNAs for building a reliable model. This approach helps to rule out underfitting by ensuring that the selected features are stable and relevant to the prediction task.\n\nThe final model comprised seven intrastable miRNAs, which were identified through feature selection and hyperparameter optimization. The performance of this model was compared to random models generated from 10,000 random seven-miRNA sets, and the intrastable miRNA model significantly outperformed the random models, further confirming its robustness and generalizability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our predictive model. One of the key methods used was cross-validation. Specifically, we performed fivefold cross-validation repeated 10 times in the training cohort. This approach helps to assess the model's performance and generalization ability by dividing the data into training and validation sets multiple times, ensuring that the model is not overly tailored to the specific characteristics of the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we used feature selection to identify the most important miRNAs for building the predictive model. By focusing on intrastable miRNAs, which show consistent abundance within individuals over time, we reduced the risk of overfitting to noise or less relevant features. This selection process was crucial in creating a model that could reliably distinguish between high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer patients.\n\nFurthermore, we optimized the hyperparameters of the random forest model using the training cohort. This step involved tuning the model's parameters to balance complexity and performance, further reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nTo validate the model's performance, we tested it on an independent validation cohort, which had not been used in the training or feature selection process. This external validation provided a rigorous assessment of the model's generalizability and ensured that it was not overfitted to the training data. The model's performance in the validation cohort was comparable to that in the training cohort, indicating its robustness and reliability.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the supplementary methods available online. These methods include the specific parameters and settings used for the random forest model, such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and other relevant hyperparameters. The optimization process involved fivefold cross-validation repeated ten times to ensure robustness and generalizability of the model.\n\nThe model files themselves, including the trained random forest model, are not explicitly provided in the main text or supplementary materials. However, the steps and procedures to generate these models are thoroughly described, allowing for replication by other researchers. The data used for training and validation, including the miRNA abundances, are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE86474), which is publicly accessible.\n\nRegarding the license, the supplementary methods and data deposition in public repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus are typically governed by open-access policies, allowing for free use and replication by the scientific community. This ensures that other researchers can access and utilize the information to validate or build upon our findings.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black box. It is based on a random forest algorithm, which is inherently interpretable. The random forest model allows for the assessment of feature importance, providing insights into which miRNAs contribute most to the predictions.\n\nThe model was built using seven intrastable miRNAs: miR-3195, let-7b-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-451a, miR-148a-3p, miR-512-5p, and miR-431-5p. These miRNAs were selected based on their temporal stability within individuals and their ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer patients. The importance of each miRNA in the model can be quantified, indicating their relative contribution to the predictive power of the model.\n\nFurthermore, the functional associations of these miRNAs with cancer aggressivity have been established in previous studies. For example, miR-451a and miR-148a are known to regulate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in prostate cancer. Let-7b is associated with biochemical relapse in high-risk patients, and miR-144-3p has been identified as a potential biomarker in colorectal cancer. These functional insights add another layer of interpretability to the model, linking the predictive miRNAs to known biological processes.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation in the training cohort and an independent validation cohort, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.72 in the training cohort and 0.74 in the validation cohort, indicating good predictive accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the model is transparent and interpretable, with clear examples of how specific miRNAs contribute to the predictions. The functional associations of these miRNAs with cancer aggressivity further enhance the model's interpretability, providing a biological basis for the predictions.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in our study is a classification model. It is designed to distinguish between two risk groups of prostate cancer patients: high-risk and low-risk. The model uses a machine-learning approach, specifically a random forest algorithm, to classify patients based on the abundance of intrastable miRNAs in their urine samples. The performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which is a common metric for assessing the effectiveness of classification models. The model achieved a mean AUC of 0.72 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.74 in the validation cohort, indicating its ability to accurately classify patients into the correct risk groups.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a multi-step process to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the predictive model. Initially, a discovery cohort consisting of 10 patients was used to measure intra- and interindividual variability of miRNA abundance, identifying intrastable miRNAs. These intrastable miRNAs were then used as features to build a predictive model in a training cohort of 99 patients, which included 50 high-risk and 49 low-risk individuals. The model was built using a random forest algorithm with feature selection and hyperparameter optimization.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the model, 10 times repeated fivefold cross-validation was performed in the training cohort, resulting in a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72. This indicates the model's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer patients.\n\nSubsequently, the model was validated in an independent validation cohort of 40 patients, which included 11 high-risk and 29 low-risk individuals. The model demonstrated similar efficacy in this cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.74. This validation step is crucial as it assesses the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its generalizability.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of intraindividual temporal stability for biomarkers was quantified by generating a signature from intravariable miRNAs. This approach reduced prediction accuracy, highlighting the significance of using intrastable miRNAs. Furthermore, 10,000 random seven-miRNA sets were generated to build models, and their AUCs were compared to the seven-miRNA model. The random models had statistically significantly lower AUCs, underscoring the superior performance of the intrastable miRNA model.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of urine miRNAs in reflecting tumor tissue miRNA abundances, tumor tissue miRNAs were profiled from nine patients with matched urine samples. The global abundance profiles were positively correlated between matched urine and tumor samples, confirming the potential tumor origins of the biomarker. The abundances of the seven component miRNAs in the biomarker were also strongly positively correlated, further validating the model's reliability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the predictive model was primarily evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). This metric was chosen because it provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer patients.\n\nIn the training cohort, consisting of 99 patients, the model achieved a mean AUC of 0.72 through 10 times repeated fivefold cross-validation. This indicates a good level of performance in distinguishing between the two risk groups.\n\nThe model's performance was further validated in an independent cohort of 40 patients, where it achieved an AUC of 0.74. This result demonstrates the model's robustness and generalizability to new, unseen data.\n\nTo contextualize these results, the AUC of the model was compared to that of random models. Specifically, 10,000 random seven-miRNA sets were generated, and models were built from each. These random models had significantly lower AUCs, with a mean of 0.55, underscoring the superior performance of the intrastable miRNA-based model.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the model using intravariable miRNAs (those in the lowest quartile of intraclass correlation coefficients) was evaluated. This model had a notably lower AUC of 0.55, highlighting the importance of intraindividual stability in the miRNAs used for prediction.\n\nThe reported AUC values are comparable to those of many tissue-based prognostic assays, suggesting that the urine miRNA signature is a strong noninvasive alternative. The use of AUC as the primary performance metric is consistent with common practices in the literature for evaluating binary classification models, particularly in the context of cancer prognosis.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the predictive model's performance includes confidence intervals for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In the training cohort, the model achieved a mean AUC of 0.72 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.69 to 0.76. Similarly, in the validation cohort, the AUC was 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.55 to 0.92. These intervals provide a measure of the uncertainty around the point estimates of the AUC, indicating the range within which the true AUC is likely to fall.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed to compare the performance of different miRNA signatures. The intrastable miRNA signature, which includes seven specific miRNAs, was found to have a significantly higher AUC compared to signatures based on intravariable miRNAs and randomly selected miRNAs. The AUC of the intrastable signature was 0.74, while the intravariable and random signatures had AUCs of 0.55. This difference was statistically significant, with a bootstrap P-value of 0.003, indicating that the intrastable signature's performance exceeds that of the other signatures.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of intraindividual temporal stability for biomarkers was quantified by comparing the performance of the intrastable miRNA signature to one generated from intravariable miRNAs. The reduction in prediction accuracy from an AUC of 0.74 to 0.55 when not exploiting intrastable miRNAs further supports the significance of intraindividual stability in biomarker development. The null distribution of urine miRNA biomarkers was also evaluated by generating 10,000 random seven-miRNA sets, and the intrastable signature's performance was found to be statistically significantly higher than that of the random models.",
