  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from individuals participating in a long-term fasting program. The study involved 109 participants who underwent a medically supervised fasting regimen. These participants were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, excluding those with predefined contraindications to fasting, such as cachexia, advanced kidney or liver insufficiency, dementia, or other chronic psychiatric diseases. Additionally, participants who could not follow the study procedure due to language barriers or concurrent participation in another study were excluded.\n\nThe fasting protocol followed peer-reviewed guidelines, including physical exercise and individual treatments. Participants received a 600 kcal diet the day before fasting, followed by a calorie intake of approximately 250 kcal/day during the fasting period, primarily from organic juice, vegetable soup, and honey. Water and non-caloric herbal teas were also encouraged.\n\nClinical data were collected according to the Buchinger Wilhelmi Clinic (BWC) standards. Measurements were taken at two time points: before starting the fast and on the 10th fasting day. These measurements included height, waist circumference, body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, energy levels, and well-being index (WHO-5). Blood samples were collected to measure various redox biomarkers and routine laboratory parameters, such as lipid profiles, glucose levels, liver and kidney function, and inflammatory markers.\n\nThe dataset includes a comprehensive evaluation of the redox status through the measurement of 12 markers. These markers were used to predict metabolic changes, such as weight loss and LDL level decrease, using machine learning models. The statistical analysis was performed using R, with correlations studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient and associations evaluated using linear mixed models. The performance of the machine learning model was tested on a subset of the participants.\n\nNot applicable",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into two main parts for the purpose of training and testing a machine learning model. The training set constituted 60% of the total patients, while the remaining 40% formed the testing set. This split was used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting outcomes related to weight loss and LDL level decrease. The distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 109 individuals who underwent long-term fasting. To evaluate the predictive ability of redox status markers on metabolic changes, the dataset was split into a training set and a test set. The training set constituted 60% of the patients, while the test set included the remaining 40%.\n\nThe training and test sets were designed to be independent. This independence was enforced by ensuring that the data from the training set was not used in any way to influence the test set, thereby preventing data leakage and maintaining the integrity of the model evaluation process.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of metabolic and redox status studies. The use of a relatively small but well-characterized cohort allowed for a detailed analysis of the interplay between redox status and metabolic changes during fasting. The machine learning model demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting metabolic outcomes, suggesting that the antioxidant status is a crucial determinant of these changes. This performance indicates that the dataset's distribution and splitting strategy were effective in capturing the underlying relationships between the variables.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study does not mention the release of the dataset in a public forum. The data was collected as part of a specific research project involving a fasting program and the measurement of various clinical and biochemical parameters. The study acknowledges the participation of patients and the support of various individuals and teams in data collection. However, there is no information provided about the availability of the dataset for public access or reuse. Therefore, it is not possible to provide details on the data splits used or the license under which the data might be released.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm used in this study is a linear model, specifically implemented using the caret package in R. This package is designed for classification and regression training, making it suitable for predictive modeling tasks.\n\nThe algorithm employed is not new; it is a well-established approach in the field of machine learning. The choice of using a linear model was driven by its simplicity and effectiveness in evaluating the most important predictors of weight loss and LDL level decrease. The model was trained on a dataset constituting 60% of the patients and then tested on the remaining 40% to validate its performance.\n\nThe decision to use this particular algorithm was likely influenced by its robustness and the ability to handle the specific dataset and research questions at hand. The focus of the study was on understanding the interplay between markers of redox status and metabolic changes during long-term fasting, rather than developing a novel machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm was chosen for its practical applicability and reliability in achieving the study's objectives.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it directly utilizes redox status markers measured at baseline to predict metabolic changes due to long-term fasting. The machine learning approach used here is a linear model, which was trained to evaluate the most important predictors of weight loss and LDL level decrease. The training set consisted of 60% of the patients, while the remaining 40% were used as an independent test set to validate the model's performance. This ensures that the training data is independent from the test data, maintaining the integrity of the model's evaluation. The model's predictive ability was assessed by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes, demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between the predicted LDL decrease and the actual LDL decrease.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Missing values were handled by imputing them as column medians using the `randomForest::na.roughfix()` function. This method is robust and helps to maintain the integrity of the dataset by filling in missing values based on the existing data patterns.\n\nVariables in the training sets were scaled and centered before applying the linear model. Scaling and centering are crucial preprocessing steps that standardize the data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the model. This is particularly important when dealing with features that have different units or scales.\n\nThe machine learning model was trained using the `caret` package in R, specifically the `caret::train()` function. This function is part of the Classification And Regression Training (caret) package, which provides a unified interface for training and evaluating machine learning models. The model was trained on a subset of the data constituting 60% of the patients, which served as the training set.\n\nThe performance of the machine learning model was evaluated by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes using a correlation test. This step is essential to assess the model's predictive accuracy and reliability. The model was then tested on the remaining 40% of the patients, which served as the independent test set. This approach ensures that the model's performance is validated on unseen data, providing a more robust evaluation of its predictive capabilities.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we evaluated 12 markers of the redox status. These markers were used as input parameters for our machine learning model to predict metabolic changes during long-term fasting. The selection of these parameters was based on their established roles in reflecting oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. The markers included both indicators of oxidative stress/damage, such as TBARS and carbonyls, and markers of antioxidant capacity, including GSH, TAC, superoxide scavenging capacity, reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, ABTS radical scavenging capacity, as well as the activities of GPx, SOD, and GR. The choice of these parameters was informed by previous research and their known relevance to metabolic health and redox status.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized 12 markers of the redox status as input features. These markers included indicators of oxidative stress/damage such as TBARS and carbonyls, as well as markers of antioxidant capacity like GSH, TAC, superoxide scavenging capacity, reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, ABTS radical scavenging capacity, and the activities of GPx, SOD, and GR.\n\nFeature selection was performed using a machine learning approach. Specifically, we employed the caret package in R to evaluate which redox markers were the most important predictors of metabolic changes, particularly weight loss and LDL level decrease. The feature selection process was conducted using the training set, which constituted 60% of the patients. This ensured that the model's performance was validated on an independent test set comprising the remaining 40% of the patients, thereby avoiding overfitting and ensuring the robustness of our findings.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved evaluating 12 markers of the redox status in 109 individuals, which is a relatively large number of parameters compared to the number of training points. To address potential overfitting, a machine learning model was trained on a subset of the data (60% of the patients) and then tested on the remaining 40%. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data and is not merely memorizing the training set.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, missing values were imputed using the randomForest::na.roughfix() method, which is robust to overfitting. Additionally, variables in the training sets were scaled and centered before applying a linear model to evaluate the most important predictors of weight loss and LDL level decrease. This preprocessing step helps to ensure that the model is not unduly influenced by the scale of the input features.\n\nThe performance of the machine learning model was evaluated by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes using a correlation test. The model showed a statistically significant correlation between the predicted LDL decrease and the actual LDL decrease (p = 0.016), indicating that it has good predictive ability.\n\nTo address potential underfitting, the study used a comprehensive set of redox markers and clinical parameters. The correlations between these markers and clinical parameters were studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and associations were evaluated using linear mixed models. This approach helps to ensure that the model captures the complex relationships between the redox status and metabolic changes.\n\nOverall, the study employed a rigorous approach to fitting the model, including cross-validation, preprocessing, and comprehensive evaluation, to ensure that it neither overfits nor underfits the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting when developing our machine learning model. One key method involved the use of a training set that constituted 60% of the patients, while the remaining 40% were reserved for an independent test set. This approach ensured that our model's performance could be validated on unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we performed variable scaling and centering before training the model. This preprocessing step helps to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, preventing any single feature from dominating the learning process and thus mitigating overfitting.\n\nWe also utilized the caret package in R, which includes built-in mechanisms for regularization. Specifically, we employed the `train` function, which supports various regularization techniques such as ridge regression and lasso regression. These methods add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models and promoting generalization to new data.\n\nFurthermore, missing values in the dataset were imputed using the `na.roughfix` function from the randomForest package, which uses a robust method to handle missing data. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the dataset and ensuring that the model does not overfit to the imputed values.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively helped to enhance the robustness and generalizability of our machine learning model, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box. It is designed to be interpretable, allowing us to understand the contributions of various redox parameters to the predictive ability of the model. Specifically, the machine learning algorithm used a combination of antioxidant parameters measured at baseline to predict changes in markers of metabolic health caused by long-term fasting. The model identified lipid peroxidation as the most important predictor of changes in LDL levels. This transparency is crucial because it enables us to see which redox parameters are driving the predictions, providing clear insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. For instance, the model showed that higher levels of lipid peroxidation at baseline were associated with a reduced normalization effect of fasting on LDL levels. This interpretability allows for targeted interventions and personalized fasting strategies based on an individual's redox status.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a regression model. It was designed to predict continuous outcomes, specifically the changes in metabolic parameters such as weight loss and LDL level decrease, rather than classifying outcomes into discrete categories. The model utilized a linear regression approach within the caret package in R, which is suited for regression tasks. The performance of the model was evaluated by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes, further confirming its regression nature. The primary goal was to forecast the amplitude of metabolic changes based on the redox status markers, making it a regression model.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive statistical analysis using R version 4.0.0. Correlations were studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient to understand the relationships between various clinical parameters. Pairwise comparisons were performed using a paired t-test to assess differences between measurements taken at different time points.\n\nAssociations between different clinical parameters were evaluated using linear mixed models, considering the time point as a covariate and the repeated measure (patient grouping) as a random effect. Likelihood Ratio Tests were performed to evaluate the significance of these effects.\n\nTo predict the amplitude of metabolic changes, markers of the redox status were used. The caret package in R was utilized for Classification And Regression Training. The dataset was split into a training set constituting 60% of the patients and a test set with the remaining 40% of the patients. Missing values in the training set were imputed as column medians using the randomForest::na.roughfix() function. Variables in the training set were scaled and centered before applying a linear model to evaluate the most important predictors of weight loss and LDL level decrease using the caret::train() function.\n\nThe performance of the machine learning model was evaluated by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes using a correlation test. This approach ensured that the model's predictions were validated against real data, providing a robust assessment of its accuracy and reliability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our machine learning model, we focused on assessing its predictive performance using correlation tests. Specifically, we correlated the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes to evaluate the model's accuracy. This approach allowed us to determine how well our model, trained on a subset of patients, could generalize to the remaining patients.\n\nThe primary performance metric reported was the correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and direction of the relationship between the predicted and actual outcomes. A higher correlation coefficient indicates better predictive performance. This metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating regression models, making it a representative choice for our study.\n\nAdditionally, we used a linear model to identify the most important predictors of weight loss and LDL level decrease. This step was crucial in understanding which redox markers were most influential in predicting metabolic changes during long-term fasting. The use of linear models for feature importance is also a standard practice in the field, ensuring that our approach is aligned with established methods.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are correlation coefficients and feature importance from linear models. These metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in similar contexts.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focuses on the interplay between markers of the redox status and metabolic changes observed during long-term fasting. It does not involve the development or evaluation of new methods or algorithms that would require a comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The methods used in the study are well-established protocols for measuring various biomarkers and statistical analyses, which are described in detail. The study's primary goal is to understand the biological processes and correlations, rather than to compare or validate methodological approaches.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics included statistical significance tests to ensure the robustness of our findings. We employed paired t-tests for pairwise comparisons and linear mixed models to evaluate associations between clinical parameters, considering time points as covariates and patient grouping as a random effect. Likelihood Ratio Tests were performed to assess the significance of these effects.\n\nFor the machine learning model, we used a training set constituting 60% of the patients to predict the amplitude of metabolic changes. Missing values were imputed using the randomForest::na.roughfix() method, and variables were scaled and centered before applying a linear model with the caret::train() function. The model's performance was evaluated on the remaining 40% of the patients by correlating the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes using a correlation test. This approach provided a clear indication of the model's predictive accuracy and reliability.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in our analysis. The use of paired t-tests and linear mixed models ensured that the observed effects were not due to random chance. The correlation tests for the machine learning model further validated the model's performance, providing confidence in its ability to predict metabolic changes accurately.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The study was conducted with a focus on understanding the interplay between markers of the redox status and metabolic changes during long-term fasting. The data collected includes various clinical parameters and redox biomarkers measured at specific time points. However, the detailed raw data from these evaluations is not released to the public. The study does provide comprehensive results and analyses, but the specific raw files used for these evaluations are not accessible."
