  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset for this study was sourced from a retrospective analysis of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The study population consisted of 1843 HBV-infected patients enrolled between July 2008 and November 2017. After excluding patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or other tumors (193 patients), liver abscess (86 patients), and those who refused to participate or had incomplete data, a total of 1289 patients were included in the final analysis.\n\nThe data was collected from multiple centers, including Huai'an, Jilin, Anhui, and Beijing. The training sets consisted of 549 treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients from Huai'an and Jilin. The validation sets included 408 patients from Anhui and 332 patients from Beijing, who underwent liver biopsy with available data on transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count.\n\nThe dataset included various clinical and laboratory parameters, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values, liver enzymes (ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)), total bilirubin, platelet counts, and other biomarkers related to liver fibrosis. Additionally, ultrasonic measurements such as the size of the spleen, diameter of the splenic vein, and diameter of the portal vein were recorded.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous publications by the community, as it is specific to this study. The data was preprocessed and normalized to minimize systematic errors from different centers, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the established models. The machine learning algorithm used for analysis was implemented using Python 3.7.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized multiple data splits to train and validate the FibroBox model. Initially, two training sets were used, consisting of treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients from Huai'an and Jilin, totaling 549 patients. These sets were not entirely comparable, but the model could normalize them.\n\nFor validation, two external validation sets were employed: one from Anhui with 408 patients and another from Beijing with 332 patients. These validation sets included chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who underwent biopsy and had available data on transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and platelet count.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split varied. The training sets from Huai'an and Jilin had 252 and 297 patients, respectively. The validation sets from Anhui and Beijing had 408 and 332 patients, respectively. The characteristics of the study population, such as median age, body mass index (BMI), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values, also varied across these splits.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study involved a retrospective analysis of HBV-infected patients, with data collected from multiple centers. The datasets were split into training and validation sets to ensure independent evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nTwo training datasets were used, consisting of treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients from Huai'an and Jilin, totaling 549 patients. These sets were not entirely comparable, but the model was designed to normalize these differences. The validation sets included cohorts from Anhui (408 patients) and Beijing (332 patients), which consisted of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who had undergone biopsy with available data on transient elastography (TE), AST, ALT, and platelet count.\n\nTo enforce independence between training and validation sets, the data from different geographical locations were used. This approach helped to mitigate potential biases and ensured that the model's performance could be generalized to new, unseen data. The distribution of the datasets in terms of patient characteristics, such as age, sex, and laboratory parameters, was compared across the training and validation sets to ensure representativeness and comparability.\n\nThe study design aimed to address dataset redundancy by using multiple, independent cohorts for training and validation. This approach is consistent with best practices in machine learning for medical research, where the goal is to develop models that can be reliably applied to diverse patient populations. The use of external validation sets from different regions helped to assess the model's robustness and generalizability, which is crucial for its clinical applicability.",

This waiver allows for the data to be freely used, shared, and built upon by anyone, even for commercial purposes, with no restrictions. This ensures that the data is accessible to the public and can be used for further research and analysis.\n\nThe data was enforced by following the guidelines proposed by Boursier et al. The data was collected from a study population of 1843 HBV-infected patients, with 1289 patients finally included in the study after excluding those who refused to participate, had co-infections, or had incomplete data. The data was collected from four centers, ensuring the applicability and reliability of the established models. The data was also normalized to minimize systematic errors from different centers.\n\nThe data splits used in the study include training sets from Huai'an and Jilin, and validation sets from Anhui and Beijing. The training sets consisted of 549 treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients who entirely met the study criteria. The validation sets consisted of 408 patients from Anhui and 332 patients from Beijing who underwent biopsy with available data on TE, AST, ALT, and platelet count. The data splits were used to evaluate the diagnostic performances of the FibroBox and other noninvasive markers.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is a supervised learning algorithm, specifically a logistic regression model with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This type of algorithm is well-established and widely used in the field of machine learning and statistics for feature selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new, as LASSO logistic regression is a well-known technique in the machine learning community. However, the specific application and implementation of this algorithm in the context of predicting significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in HBV-infected patients is novel. The development of the FibroBox model involves the integration of various clinical and laboratory parameters, including ultrasound measurements and liver stiffness measurements, which have been selected and optimized using LASSO logistic regression and filter methods.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of this study is on the medical application and validation of the FibroBox model rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to address a specific clinical need by leveraging existing machine-learning techniques to create a noninvasive tool for predicting liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in CHB patients. The implementation of the machine-learning algorithm was conducted using Python 3.7, which is a common programming language for data analysis and machine learning. The statistical analysis and model validation were performed using established software tools such as R and SPSS, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the results.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is a meta-predictor known as FibroBox. It integrates data from various sources, including Fibroscan results, serum biomarker indices, and ultrasonic measurements. The FibroBox model leverages machine learning algorithms to select significant variables and conduct training and validation.\n\nThe construction of FibroBox involves multiple steps, including data normalization to minimize systematic errors from different centers. The machine learning algorithm used for this model is implemented in Python 3.7. The specific machine-learning methods that constitute the whole are not explicitly detailed, but the process involves feature selection using parametric methods like the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. This regression helps in identifying the most relevant features for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n\nThe training data sets used for FibroBox come from treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients from Huai’an and Jilin, totaling 549 patients. These sets are not absolutely comparable, but the model normalizes them to ensure consistency. The validation sets include cohorts from Anhui and Beijing, with patients who underwent biopsy and had available data on transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count.\n\nThe independence of the training data is not explicitly stated, but the use of external validation sets from different geographical locations suggests an effort to ensure that the training and validation data are independent. This independence is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the model's predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for training and validation. All variables were normalized to minimize systematic errors from different centers. This normalization process was crucial to standardize the data and prevent any single variable from disproportionately influencing the model.\n\nThe preprocessing also included selecting significant variables through algorithm models. This step involved using statistical methods to identify which variables had the most predictive power for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. Variables such as Fibroscan results, platelet count, alanine transaminase (ALT), prothrombin time (PT), type III procollagen aminoterminal peptide (PIIINP), type IV collagen, laminin, hyaluronic acid (HA), and diameter of spleen vein were selected as input variables for the FibroBox model.\n\nThe machine learning algorithm was implemented using Python 3.7. This implementation allowed for the efficient handling of large datasets and the application of complex algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within the data. The use of Python also facilitated the integration of various statistical and machine learning libraries, which were essential for the development and validation of the FibroBox model.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The FibroBox model utilizes a set of input parameters that were carefully selected through a combination of statistical analyses. Initially, Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to identify variables associated with the presence of fibrosis stages. This analysis highlighted several variables, including age, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, platelet count, WBC, PT, ALP, albumin, INR, PIIINP, type IV collagen, laminin, HA, size of spleen, diameter of spleen vein, diameter of portal vein, velocity of portal vein, and Fibroscan results.\n\nSubsequently, a multivariable analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was employed to further refine the selection of significant variables. This method helped in identifying the most relevant parameters for the diagnostic models. The final set of input parameters selected for the FibroBox model included Fibroscan results, platelet count, AST, PT, PIIINP, type IV collagen, laminin, HA, and the diameter of the portal vein. These parameters were chosen based on their strong association with fibrosis stages and their ability to improve the model's diagnostic performance.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process of our model, feature selection was indeed performed. This was done using the training set only, ensuring that the validation process remained unbiased. The feature selection process involved using a parametric method known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. This method helped in identifying the most significant variables associated with the presence of fibrosis stages.\n\nAs a result of this feature selection, nine features were chosen as input parameters for the diagnostic models aimed at predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. These selected features included Fibroscan results, platelet count, AST, PT, PIIINP, type IV collagen, laminin, HA, and the diameter of the portal vein. These features were then used as inputs for our FibroBox model, which demonstrated favorable diagnostic performances in predicting both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of a machine learning algorithm implemented in Python 3.7. The algorithm selected significant variables through a combination of Spearman correlation analysis and multivariate analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant features for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n\nThe number of parameters considered was substantial, including variables such as age, AST, GGT, platelet count, PIIINP, type IV collagen, laminin, HA, and diameter of portal vein. To address the potential issue of over-fitting, given the large number of parameters relative to the training points, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data from different centers were normalized to minimize systematic errors. Secondly, the use of LASSO logistic regression helped in feature selection by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients, which effectively reduced the model complexity and prevented over-fitting. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using external validation sets from Anhui and Beijing cohorts, ensuring that the model generalized well to new, unseen data.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the model's performance was extensively evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the rate of correctly classified fibrosis/cirrhosis. The AUROC values for the FibroBox model were consistently higher than those of conventional fibrosis markers like TE, APRI, and FIB-4, indicating that the model captured the underlying patterns in the data effectively. Furthermore, decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that FibroBox provided a larger net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities, reinforcing the model's robustness and ability to generalize beyond the training data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful for selecting significant variables and conducting training and validation in our algorithmic model, FibroBox. By normalizing all variables, we minimized systematic errors from different centers, ensuring a more robust and reliable model. The LASSO method helps in reducing the complexity of the model by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This approach was crucial in enhancing the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting, thereby improving the diagnostic accuracy of FibroBox.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that the algorithm models and training/testing procedures of FibroBox are described in the supplementary material. This suggests that the specific details regarding the optimization parameters and configurations might be available there.\n\nThe study utilized Python 3.7 for implementing the machine learning algorithm and R 3.5.1 for decision curve analysis and ROC analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 19.0. These tools and software versions are standard and widely used in the field, ensuring reproducibility and reliability.\n\nThe data characteristics, preprocessing, and training/testing procedures are also mentioned to be described in the supplementary material. This indicates that the methodology and parameters used for optimization are documented, although the exact details are not provided in the main text.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing, the article is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

This ensures that the data and supplementary materials are accessible for further research and validation.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model, FibroBox, is not a blackbox model. It is designed to be interpretable, utilizing a combination of clinical variables and ultrasound measurements to predict fibrosis stages. The input parameters for the diagnostic models include Fibroscan results, platelet count, AST, PT, PIIINP, type IV collagen, laminin, HA, and the diameter of the portal vein. These variables were selected based on their significant correlation with fibrosis stages, as determined through Spearman correlation analysis and combined multivariate analysis.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of decision curve analysis (DCA), which graphically demonstrates the net benefit of FibroBox compared to other markers like TE, APRI, and FIB-4. This analysis helps in understanding the clinical utility and the range of threshold probabilities where FibroBox provides a larger net benefit.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the rate of correctly classified fibrosis/cirrhosis. The optimal cut-off values for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis are clearly defined (0.38 and 0.56, respectively), providing a straightforward interpretation of the model's predictions.\n\nThe use of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python and statistical analyses conducted with R and SPSS ensures that the model's decisions are based on robust and reproducible methods. The normalization of variables and the inclusion of data from multiple centers further enhance the model's reliability and applicability.",
  "model/output": "The model, referred to as FibroBox, is a classification model designed to predict the stages of liver fibrosis. It specifically aims to diagnose significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. The model uses optimal cut-off values of 0.38 for significant fibrosis and 0.56 for cirrhosis, which were determined during the training phase. These cut-off values were then applied to validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n\nThe model's output is binary, classifying patients into categories based on the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis. The diagnostic performance of FibroBox was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and correctly classified rates. For instance, in the Anhui cohort, the AUROC for predicting significant fibrosis was 0.88, and for cirrhosis, it was 0.87. Similarly, in the Beijing cohort, the AUROC for predicting significant fibrosis was 0.87, and for cirrhosis, it was 0.90.\n\nThe model's performance was compared with other diagnostic tools such as transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Across different cohorts, FibroBox consistently showed superior or comparable diagnostic accuracy. The model's inputs include a combination of Fibroscan results, serum biomarker indices, and ultrasonic measurements, which were selected through a multivariate analysis and feature selection process.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithmic model, FibroBox, is not publicly released. The machine learning algorithm was implemented using Python 3.7, but there is no mention of an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance being made available for public use. Therefore, no method to run the algorithm is publicly accessible.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the FibroBox algorithm involved a comprehensive process using multiple datasets and statistical methods. Two training datasets from Huai'an and Jilin, consisting of 549 treatment-naïve HBV-infected patients, were used to develop the algorithm. These datasets, while not entirely comparable, were normalized to ensure consistency.\n\nThe diagnostic performance of FibroBox was assessed using external validation sets from Anhui and Beijing cohorts. The Anhui cohort included 408 patients, and the Beijing cohort included 332 patients. These cohorts consisted of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who had undergone liver biopsy, with available data on transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count.\n\nThe evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the rate of correctly classified fibrosis/cirrhosis. Delong's test was used to compare AUROC values between FibroBox and other markers, with a significance level of 0.05. Cohen's kappa coefficient was employed to describe the agreements between different diagnostic methods. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and ROC analysis were computed using R 3.5.1, while statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 19.0.\n\nThe study also addressed the limitations, such as the retrospective nature of the research and data sample inconsistency, which could affect model validation. Despite these challenges, the large size of the research data and the involvement of four centers ensured the applicability and reliability of the established models. The evaluation process was designed to provide robust and reliable results, demonstrating the effectiveness of FibroBox in diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we reported several performance metrics to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FibroBox and other conventional fibrosis markers. The primary metric used was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between different stages of fibrosis. We also reported the sensitivity and specificity at optimal cutoff values, which indicate the true positive rate and true negative rate, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), which reflect the probability that a positive or negative test result is a true positive or true negative. The likelihood ratios (positive and negative) were also provided, offering insights into how much a test result will change the odds of having the disease.\n\nThe correctly classified rate was another key metric, representing the proportion of patients who were accurately classified by the model. This metric was reported for both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we compared the AUROC values of FibroBox with those of other markers using Delong's test, which helps determine if the differences in AUROC are statistically significant. We also employed decision curve analysis (DCA) to graphically demonstrate the net benefit of FibroBox compared to other markers across a range of threshold probabilities. This analysis provided supplementary evidence for the comparison of FibroBox with transient elastography (TE) in predicting cirrhosis.\n\nThese metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating diagnostic tests, ensuring that our results can be compared with other studies in the field. The use of multiple metrics allows for a thorough assessment of the model's performance, providing a clear picture of its strengths and areas for improvement.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The evaluation of our method, FibroBox, included a comprehensive comparison with other publicly available and widely used non-invasive markers for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Specifically, we compared FibroBox against Transient Elastography (TE), the AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. These comparisons were conducted using external validation sets from two different cohorts: Anhui and Beijing.\n\nThe diagnostic performance of FibroBox was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of correctly classified fibrosis/cirrhosis. The results demonstrated that FibroBox consistently outperformed the other markers in terms of AUROC values and correctly classified rates. For instance, in the Beijing cohort, FibroBox achieved an AUROC of 0.90 for distinguishing between F0-1 and F2-4 stages, compared to 0.89 for TE, 0.75 for APRI, and 0.70 for FIB-4.\n\nAdditionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to evaluate the clinical net benefit of FibroBox across a range of threshold probabilities. The DCA graphically showed that FibroBox provided a larger net benefit compared to TE, APRI, and FIB-4 in diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. This supplementary evidence further supported the superior performance of FibroBox in predicting cirrhosis, with a p-value of 0.058 when compared to TE.\n\nIn summary, the comparison with simpler baselines and publicly available methods on benchmark datasets confirmed the robustness and reliability of FibroBox as a non-invasive tool for assessing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model, FibroBox, includes performance metrics with confidence intervals, providing a clear indication of the reliability of our results. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis includes 95% confidence intervals, such as 0.87 (0.83 to 0.91) and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.94), respectively. These intervals help to understand the precision of our estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. We compared FibroBox with other methods like transient elastography (TE), AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and FIB-4. The results show that FibroBox significantly outperforms APRI and FIB-4 in predicting both significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. For example, the p-values for these comparisons are all less than 0.001, indicating strong statistical significance. When comparing FibroBox with TE, the results are also promising, although not always statistically significant. For instance, the p-value for predicting cirrhosis is 0.863, suggesting no significant difference, while for significant fibrosis, the p-value is less than 0.001, indicating superiority.\n\nDecision curve analysis (DCA) further supports the superiority of FibroBox. It graphically demonstrates that FibroBox provides a larger net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities compared to TE, APRI, and FIB-4. This supplementary evidence strengthens our claim that FibroBox is a more effective tool for diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics with confidence intervals and statistically significant results provide a robust evaluation of FibroBox, confirming its superiority over existing methods in many cases.",
