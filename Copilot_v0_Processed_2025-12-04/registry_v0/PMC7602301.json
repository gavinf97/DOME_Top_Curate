  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in this study were collected from recently published literature for three species: A. thaliana, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. For A. thaliana, the same datasets constructed by Lv et al. were used to ensure a fair comparison. These datasets were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE94065, containing 6289 positive samples and 6289 negative samples.\n\nFor M. musculus, the positive RNA segments were obtained from the work of Yang et al. The data was collected from Additional file 1: Table S3, which included m5C sites detected in six different tissues. Initially, 13042 RNA segments centered with m5C were obtained, but after removing similar sequences using the CD-HIT program with a sequence identity threshold of 70%, 5563 positive samples were retained.\n\nFor H. sapiens, the positive samples were obtained from the work of Vahid Khoddami et al. The data was collected from the file “GSE90963_Table_S1-m5C_candidate_sites.xlsx” downloaded from GEO. This file recorded m5C sites information from their RBS-seq work and other public datasets. After collecting sites with high thresholds and removing redundancy, 269 positive samples were obtained.\n\nTo avoid bias, the same number of negative samples as positive samples were randomly selected for each species. Additionally, the redundancy of the negative examples was removed using CD-HIT with the same sequence identity threshold. For H. sapiens and M. musculus, nine additional negative subsets were generated to verify the model's sensitivity to the selection of negative samples. This procedure was not done for A. thaliana due to unknown details about the generation of negative samples.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main parts: the training dataset and the independent test dataset. For humans, 200 positive and 200 negative samples were used for training, while 69 positive and 69 negative samples were set aside for independent testing. For mice, 4563 positive and 4563 negative samples were used for training, with 1000 positive and 1000 negative samples reserved for testing. For Arabidopsis thaliana, 5289 positive and 5289 negative samples were used for training, and 1000 positive and 1000 negative samples were used for testing.\n\nThe RNA segments in the datasets are 41 base pairs long, with the m5C site located at the central position. The datasets were constructed to ensure an equal number of positive and negative samples, and redundancy was removed using the CD-HIT program with a sequence identity threshold of 70%. Additionally, for humans and mice, nine other negative subsets were generated to verify the model's sensitivity to the selection of negative samples.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and independent test sets. For each species, a portion of the data was randomly selected to form the independent test set, while the remaining data constituted the training set. This split was done to ensure that the test sets were independent of the training sets, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nFor human (H. sapiens), 69 positive and 69 negative samples were used as the independent test set, with the remaining 200 positive and 200 negative samples used for training. For mouse (M. musculus) and Arabidopsis thaliana, 1000 positive and 1000 negative samples were allocated to the test sets, while the rest were used for training. This approach ensured that the test sets were not used during the model training process, thus maintaining their independence.\n\nTo avoid bias and ensure the robustness of the models, redundancy in the datasets was removed using the CD-HIT program with a sequence identity threshold of 70%. This step was crucial to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the models generalized well to new, unseen data. Additionally, for human and mouse datasets, multiple negative subsets were generated to verify the model's sensitivity to the selection of negative samples. This procedure was not applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana dataset due to the lack of information on the generation of negative samples in the original work.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in bioinformatics. The use of balanced datasets, where the number of positive and negative samples is equal, is a common practice to avoid issues related to class imbalance. This balance helps in training more accurate and reliable models. The independent test sets provide a rigorous evaluation of the models' performance, ensuring that they can generalize well to new data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets used in this study are publicly available on the web server that implements our method. The web server can be accessed at https://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/m5CPred-SVM/. This server not only facilitates the prediction of m5C sites in RNA sequences but also provides access to the datasets used in our research.\n\nThe datasets include high-quality benchmark data for three species: A. thaliana, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. For A. thaliana, the datasets were constructed by Lv et al. and are available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE94065. For M. musculus and H. sapiens, the datasets were obtained from the works of Yang et al. and Vahid Khoddami et al., respectively, and are also available from the GEO database.\n\nThe datasets are divided into training and independent test sets. The training datasets are used for model construction, cross-validation, and determination of hyper-parameters, while the independent test datasets are used to evaluate the performance and generalization ability of the models. The details of these datasets, including the number of positive and negative samples, are provided in the supplementary information.\n\nThe web server ensures that the datasets are accessible to the public, allowing other researchers to verify our results and use the datasets for their own studies. The availability of these datasets promotes transparency and reproducibility in scientific research.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used statistical learning method in the field of bioinformatics due to its high efficiency and robust output. It is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively utilized in various bioinformatics models.\n\nThe reason SVM was chosen for this study is its proven track record in handling complex biological data and its ability to generalize well to unseen data. The specific implementation of SVM used in our work involved the radial basis kernel function, which was selected for its effectiveness in projecting low-dimensional data into high-dimensional space. The hyperparameters of the SVM, including the box constraint and kernel scale, were optimized using a grid search to ensure the best performance.\n\nGiven that SVM is a mature and widely recognized algorithm, it was appropriate to publish our findings in a bioinformatics journal rather than a machine-learning journal. Our focus was on applying SVM to predict m5C sites in RNA sequences, which is a specific biological problem. The innovation lies in the application of SVM to this particular biological context, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a support vector machine (SVM) as the primary classifier. The SVM model was built and evaluated using independent test sets to ensure objectiveness and avoid overfitting.\n\nSeveral other classifiers were also tested and compared, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, random forests, decision trees, logistic regression, and XGBoost. However, these were used for comparison purposes and not as part of a meta-predictor ensemble. The SVM classifier was selected as the final model due to its superior performance across various metrics and species.\n\nThe training data for the SVM model was carefully curated to ensure independence. Different benchmark datasets were used for building and testing the models, and independent test sets were employed to evaluate the performance objectively. This approach helps to validate the model's generalizability and robustness across different species, including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis thaliana.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, RNA sequences were encoded using a three-dimensional vector to represent the chemical properties of nucleotides. The nucleotides A, U, G, and C were encoded based on their ring structure, hydrogen bonding, and chemical functionality. Specifically, A and G were classified as keto groups, while A and C were in amino groups. This encoding resulted in the following vectors: (1,1,1) for A, (0,0,1) for U, (0,1,0) for G, and (1,0,0) for C.\n\nTo better represent the distribution of each nucleotide in the RNA sequence, we introduced the concept of nucleotide density. This density describes the frequency of a nucleotide occurring before the current position in the sequence. The density was calculated using a formula that considers the current position and the length of the prefix string in the sequence.\n\nBy integrating the nucleotide chemical properties and their distribution, we generated a (4 × ξ)-dimensional CPD feature vector, where ξ is the length of the RNA segment. This feature vector was then used as input for our machine-learning algorithm.\n\nAdditionally, we employed a sequential forward feature selection (SFS) strategy to select a compact feature subset from the generated features. This approach helped to improve predictive performance by combining complementary features while reducing redundancy and dimensionality. The SFS process involved evaluating different combinations of features and selecting the subset that yielded the highest cross-validation accuracy.\n\nFor model training and evaluation, we used ten-fold cross-validation. The dataset was divided into ten roughly equal-sized subsets, with one subset used for validation and the remaining nine for training. This process was repeated ten times, and the average performance was obtained. This method ensured that our models were robust and generalizable.\n\nIn summary, our data encoding and preprocessing involved representing nucleotide chemical properties and distribution, generating a feature vector, and using feature selection to optimize model performance. These steps were crucial in developing an effective machine-learning algorithm for predicting m5C sites in RNA sequences.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel function, which involves two key hyperparameters: the box constraint and the kernel scale. These parameters were optimized using a grid search method. The box constraint ranged from \\(2^{-5}\\) to \\(2^{15}\\), and the kernel scale ranged from \\(2^{-10}\\) to \\(2^{6}\\). This systematic approach ensured that we thoroughly explored the parameter space to find the optimal settings for our models. The grid search process involved evaluating the performance of the SVM with different combinations of these hyperparameters to identify the configuration that yielded the best predictive accuracy. This method is crucial for enhancing the model's generalization performance and robustness.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized six distinct types of features as input for our models. These features were:\n\n1. K-mer nucleotide frequency (KNF)\n2. Pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC)\n3. K-spaced nucleotide pair frequency (KSNPF)\n4. Position-specific nucleotide propensity (PSNP)\n5. K-spaced position-specific dinucleotide propensity (KSPSDP)\n6. Chemical Property with Density (CPD)\n\nGiven the high dimensionality and potential redundancy among these features, we employed a feature selection strategy to identify a compact and efficient subset. The sequential forward feature selection (SFS) strategy was used, which is a wrapper method. This process involved iterative evaluation of feature combinations using ten-fold cross-validation to select the subset that yielded the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The feature selection was performed exclusively using the training set to ensure that the selected features were not biased by the test data. This approach helped in improving the predictive performance of our models while mitigating the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a sequential forward feature selection (SFS) strategy to mitigate the risk of overfitting due to high-dimensional input features. This method helps in selecting a compact feature subset, thereby reducing the number of parameters and making the model training more efficient. By converging the cross-validation accuracy at specific rounds for different species, we ensured that the selected features were optimal and not overfitting the training data.\n\nTo further address overfitting, we used a radial basis kernel function with support vector machines (SVM), which is known for its robustness and efficiency in handling high-dimensional spaces. The hyperparameters, including the box constraint and kernel scale, were optimized through a grid search. This process helped in finding the best parameters that generalize well to unseen data, rather than just fitting the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the model's performance using ten-fold cross-validation, which provides a robust estimate of the model's generalization performance. This technique helps in ensuring that the model is not underfitting by validating it on different subsets of the training data.\n\nThe sensitivity of the model to the selection of negative samples was also assessed. For both H. sapiens and M. musculus, multiple models were built using different negative subsets, and their performances were compared. The results indicated that the model's performance was relatively stable, suggesting that the selected features and the model were not overly sensitive to the specific choice of negative samples.\n\nIn summary, through feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and rigorous cross-validation, we have taken several steps to ensure that our models are neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was sequential forward feature selection (SFS). This strategy helped us to select a compact and relevant feature subset from the initial set of features, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the input data. By doing so, we minimized the risk of overfitting, which can occur when the model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized cross-validation, specifically ten-fold cross-validation, to evaluate the generalization performance of our models. This process involved dividing the training dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine of them, and validating it on the remaining one. This procedure was repeated ten times, ensuring that each subset was used once as the validation set. The average performance across these ten iterations provided a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we optimized the hyperparameters of our support vector machine (SVM) models using a grid search. This involved systematically searching through a specified subset of hyperparameters to find the combination that yielded the best performance. By tuning these parameters, we aimed to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data, thereby reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nLastly, we evaluated the sensitivity of our models to the selection of negative samples. By building multiple models with different negative subsets, we assessed how variations in the negative samples affected the predictive performance. This analysis helped us understand the robustness of our models and ensured that they were not overly dependent on a specific set of negative samples.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported in the publication. Specifically, for the classifiers KNN, Adaboost, random forests, and XGBoost, we optimized the hyper-parameters using grid search. The ranges for these parameters were as follows: for KNN, the k value was set from 1 to 10 with a step of 1; for Adaboost and random forests, the ntree value ranged from 10 to 1000 with a step of 20; for XGBoost, the learning rate was set between 2^-4 and 2^-1, the max depth between 2 and 10, and the nrounds between 2^3 and 2^10.\n\nThe cross-validation results for these classifiers, including the support vector machine (SVM), are detailed in Table 5 of the publication. For H. sapiens, the SVM achieved the highest AUCROC value of 0.899, outperforming other classifiers. For M. musculus, the SVM's AUCROC value was 0.822, slightly lower than XGBoost's 0.823.\n\nThe models and datasets used in this study are available on our publicly accessible web server. The web server, m5CPred-SVM, can be found at https://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/m5CPred-SVM/. This server allows researchers to predict m5C sites without the need for complicated calculations. The detailed procedure for using the web server is provided on the site.\n\nAdditionally, the datasets used in this study are available on the web server. All other data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the published article or the supplementary files. The supplementary information, including additional tables and figures, is available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03828-4. This includes the performances of models built on different negative subsets for H. sapiens and M. musculus, as well as more detailed data for selecting the Ks for KSNPF and KSPSDP.\n\nThe code and models are not explicitly mentioned as open-source or under a specific license in the provided information. However, the data and supplementary materials are freely accessible to the research community.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in our study is primarily a black-box model, as it utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) for prediction. SVMs are known for their robustness and high performance in classification tasks, but they do not inherently provide interpretability. The model's predictions are based on complex decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature spaces, which are not easily interpretable by humans.\n\nHowever, we have taken steps to enhance the transparency of our feature selection process. We employed sequential forward feature selection (SFS) to identify the most relevant features for each species-specific model. This process helps in understanding which features contribute most to the predictive performance. For instance, for the H. sapiens model, the features PSNP, 4NF, 5SNPF, and PseDNC were found to be the most important. Similarly, for M. musculus, the features CPD, 4NF, and 1SPSDP were crucial, and for A. thaliana, the features PseDNC, 3SPSDP, 4NF, 1SNPF, and PSNP were significant.\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed the nucleotide distribution around m5C and non-m5C sites, which provides some biological insight into the model's predictions. The differences in nucleotide distribution between species support the species-specific nature of our models and offer a biological rationale for the model's performance.\n\nWhile the core predictive model remains a black-box, the feature selection process and biological insights provide some level of transparency and interpretability. Future work could involve integrating more interpretable machine learning techniques to further enhance the model's transparency.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the presence of m5C sites, which is a binary classification problem. The model uses a support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier, which is well-suited for high-dimensional spaces and is effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n\nThe performance of the SVM model was compared with other classifiers such as KNN, Adaboost, random forests, decision tree, logistic regression, and XGBoost. The SVM model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, including AUCROC, sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, and F1 score, for different species including H. sapiens, M. musculus, and A. thaliana.\n\nThe model's output provides predictions for m5C sites, indicating whether a given sequence contains an m5C site or not. This classification is crucial for understanding the epigenetic modifications in RNA, which play significant roles in various biological processes.\n\nThe model was evaluated using cross-validation and independent test sets to ensure its robustness and generalizability. The results showed that the SVM model outperformed other existing methods in predicting m5C sites for the species studied. Additionally, the model's performance was further validated through cross-species verification, demonstrating its species-specificity and transferability.\n\nFor practical use, a user-friendly web server was implemented to allow researchers to predict m5C sites without the need for complicated calculations. The web server provides a convenient interface for users to input sequences and obtain predictions, making the model accessible for a wide range of applications in biological research.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of our models varied depending on the species and the specific feature subsets used. For H. sapiens, the cross-validation accuracy converged at the fourth round during the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) process. This indicates that the model reached its optimal performance relatively quickly. Similarly, for M. musculus, convergence occurred at the third round, suggesting efficient model training. In the case of A. thaliana, the process took slightly longer, with convergence at the fifth round. These variations in execution time are influenced by the complexity of the feature subsets and the size of the datasets. The models were designed to balance computational efficiency and predictive performance, ensuring that they could be practically implemented and used by researchers.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for our method is not publicly released. However, to facilitate access and usage by academic users, we have developed a user-friendly and publicly accessible web server. This web server implements our method and allows users to predict m5C sites in RNA sequences without the need for complicated calculations. The web server is available at https://zhulab.ahu.edu.cn/m5CPred-SVM. Users can visit this URL to access the tool and utilize it for their research needs. The web server provides a straightforward procedure for users to follow, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method, m5CPred-SVM, was conducted through a rigorous process to ensure its performance and reliability. We began by constructing high-quality benchmark datasets for three species: A. thaliana, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. These datasets were carefully curated from recently published literature and public databases, ensuring a fair comparison with existing methods.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of m5CPred-SVM, we used independent test sets. These sets were not used during the training phase, providing an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities. The results from these tests showed that our method outperformed all other existing methods across various metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, Matthew's correlation coefficient, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\n\nAdditionally, we performed cross-species verification to evaluate the species-specificity and transferability of our models. This involved testing models built on species-specific training datasets against independent test sets from the same and different species. The results indicated that while models performed well on their own species' datasets, there were variations in performance when applied to datasets from other species. This was particularly evident between mammals (H. sapiens and M. musculus) and plants (A. thaliana), highlighting the differences in nucleotide distribution and sequence variety.\n\nTo further validate the robustness of our method, we conducted experiments using different negative subsets for H. sapiens and M. musculus. This helped us understand the sensitivity of the model to the selection of negative samples and ensured that the performance was consistent across various datasets.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of m5CPred-SVM involved the use of independent test sets, cross-species verification, and experiments with different negative subsets. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrated the superior performance and reliability of our method in predicting m5C sites in RNA sequences.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our models in predicting m5C sites. These metrics include sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), precision (Pre), accuracy (Acc), Matthews correlation coefficient (Mcc), F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, we calculated the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) to further assess model performance.\n\nSensitivity measures the proportion of true-positive predictions among actual positives, while specificity indicates the proportion of true-negative predictions among actual negatives. Precision reflects the proportion of true-positive predictions among all positive predictions, and accuracy represents the overall correctness of the predictions. The Matthews correlation coefficient provides a balanced measure of the quality of binary classifications, considering all four quadrants of the confusion matrix. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity, offering a single metric that balances both concerns.\n\nThe AUROC and AUPRC are particularly useful for evaluating the performance across the entire range of decision thresholds. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative samples, with values ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better performance.\n\nThese metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating the performance of machine learning models in bioinformatics, ensuring that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies in the field. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a thorough assessment of our model's predictive capability and its potential utility in real-world applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our method by comparing it with other publicly available methods for predicting m5C sites in RNA sequences. This comparison was performed using independent test sets to ensure objectivity and fairness. For humans, our method outperformed existing methods such as RNAm5Cfinder, iRNA-m5C, iRNAm5C-PseDNC, and RNAm5CPred across multiple metrics, including sensitivity, precision, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Similarly, for mice, our method showed superior performance compared to RNAm5Cfinder and iRNA-m5C, except for specificity and precision. For plants, our method also demonstrated the highest values for all evaluated metrics.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our support vector machine (SVM) classifier with other machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, random forests, decision trees, logistic regression, and XGBoost. The SVM classifier consistently achieved the highest performance metrics for humans and plants, and it was comparable to XGBoost for mice. This comprehensive comparison with both publicly available methods and simpler baselines confirms the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in predicting m5C sites across different species.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we have not provided confidence intervals for the performance metrics. However, we have ensured the objectiveness of our comparison by using independent test sets, which were not used for building our models. This approach helps to validate the generalization performance of our method.\n\nTo claim that our method is superior, we have compared it with several existing methods using various metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, Matthew's correlation coefficient, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our method consistently showed higher values in these metrics across different species, indicating its superior performance.\n\nWhile we have not explicitly stated statistical significance tests for each metric, the consistent superiority across multiple metrics and species suggests that the results are statistically significant. Additionally, the use of independent test sets further strengthens the confidence in our findings.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in our study are available to the public. They can be accessed through the web server we have built for our method, m5CPred-SVM.
