  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from multiple repositories. The Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) samples were obtained from the PCBC R package synapser. Additionally, gene expression data and related clinical information for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website. This dataset included 546 RNA-Seq expression profiles. Furthermore, 97 cases of GSE41613 data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website.\n\nThe TCGA-HNSCC RNA-Seq data underwent several preprocessing steps. Samples with expression profile information were retained, and Ensemble IDs were converted to Gene Symbols, keeping only protein-coding genes. The expression data of primary solid tumors and solid normal tissue samples were selected. For genes with multiple expressions, the median value was chosen. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were excluded from the overall survival (OS) data used for survival analysis.\n\nSimilarly, the GSE41613 data was preprocessed by retaining samples with expression profile information. The survival information unit was converted to days, and probes were changed to Gene Symbols. Probes related to multiple genes were deleted, and the median expression value was chosen for genes with multiple expressions. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were also excluded from the OS data.\n\nThe preprocessed data from both TCGA and GEO databases were used for further analysis. The TCGA dataset included 500 tumor samples and 44 normal samples, while the GSE41613 dataset consisted of 97 tumor samples. The clinical information for these datasets was also compiled and analyzed to understand the relationship between gene expression and various clinical characteristics.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of 246 samples, while the test set contained 245 samples. Additionally, an external dataset, GSE41613, was used for further validation. The training set was used to identify and optimize the genes for the prognostic risk score model, while the test set and the external dataset were used to verify the robustness of the model. The distribution of data points in each split was balanced, ensuring that the model's performance could be reliably assessed across different datasets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 491 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These samples were randomly divided into training and test sets at a ratio of 0.5:0.5, ensuring that both sets were independent. This random split was designed to maintain the integrity and independence of the datasets, preventing any overlap that could bias the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets was carefully considered to align with best practices in machine learning, particularly in the context of prognostic modeling. By ensuring an equal split, the study aimed to create a robust model that could be validated effectively. The training set was used to identify and optimize the genes for the prognostic risk score model, while the test set was used to verify the model's performance and robustness.\n\nThe clinical characteristics of the samples, such as overall survival (OS), T stage, N stage, M stage, and other relevant factors, were also taken into account to ensure that the distribution of these characteristics was comparable between the training and test sets. This approach helped to mitigate any potential biases and ensured that the model's predictions were generalizable to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study were obtained from publicly available sources. Specifically, the RNA-Seq expression data and related clinical information of HNSCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website. Additionally, the GSE41613 dataset was acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. These datasets are accessible to the public, allowing for reproducibility and further research by other scientists.\n\nThe TCGA data included 546 RNA-Seq expression profiles, while the GSE41613 dataset comprised 97 cases. Both datasets underwent preprocessing to ensure consistency and reliability. For the TCGA data, samples with expression profile information were retained, and the Ensemble IDs were converted to Gene Symbols, keeping only protein-coding genes. The expression data of primary solid tumors and solid normal tissue samples were selected, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were removed from the overall survival (OS) data used for survival analysis. Similarly, the GSE41613 data was preprocessed by retaining samples with expression profile information, converting the unit of survival information to days, and changing the probe to Gene Symbol. Probes related to several genes were deleted, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were also excluded from the OS data.\n\nThe data splits used in the study involved dividing the 491 TCGA samples into training and test sets in a 0.5:0.5 ratio. This division was done to validate the robustness of the 8-mRNAsi based signature model. The training set was used to identify genes through univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression, followed by optimization using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The test set and an external dataset (GSE41613) were used to verify the model's performance.\n\nThe datasets are available under the terms and conditions specified by TCGA and GEO, which typically include proper citation and acknowledgment of the data sources. Researchers interested in accessing these datasets can do so through the respective websites, adhering to the guidelines provided for data usage and sharing. This ensures that the data is used ethically and responsibly, promoting transparency and collaboration in scientific research.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). AIC is a statistical method used for model selection, based on the concept of information entropy. It estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model, providing a means for model selection. It is not a new machine-learning algorithm, but a well-established statistical technique widely used in various fields, including genetics and bioinformatics.\n\nThe reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that AIC is a fundamental tool in statistics and is not specific to machine learning. Its application in this study is within the context of genetic data analysis and model optimization, which is more aligned with the scope of journals in genetics and bioinformatics. The focus of the study is on identifying mRNAsi-based signatures for predicting survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a specific set of eight genes identified through a series of statistical and computational methods, including univariate Cox regression analysis, Lasso regression, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) optimization. These genes—RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1—are used to construct a prognostic risk score model. The risk score is calculated using a formula that assigns specific coefficients to the expression levels of these genes. This approach does not involve combining predictions from multiple machine-learning models; rather, it focuses on the expression levels of these eight genes to assess patient prognosis. The training and test datasets used in the study are derived from the TCGA database and an external dataset (GSE41613), ensuring that the training data is independent from the test data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the quality and relevance of the datasets used for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, the raw data of gene expression and related clinical information of HNSCC patients were downloaded from the TCGA website, which included 546 RNA-Seq expression data. Additionally, 97 cases of GSE41613 data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website.\n\nThe RNA-Seq data from TCGA-HNSCC underwent preprocessing to retain samples with expression profile information. The Ensemble IDs were converted to Gene Symbols, and only protein-coding genes were retained. The expression data of primary solid tumors and solid normal tissue samples were selected, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were removed from the overall survival (OS) data used for survival analysis.\n\nSimilarly, the GSE41613 data was preprocessed to keep samples with expression profile information. The unit of survival information of the samples was converted to days, and the probes were changed to Gene Symbols. Probes related to several genes were deleted, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. As with the TCGA data, samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were removed from the OS data used for survival analysis.\n\nThe expression data of pluripotent stem cells (ESC and iPSC) from the PCBC database were analyzed to predict mRNAsi using the OCLR algorithm. The Kruskal-Wallis test was then used to compare the mRNAsi of normal tissue and tumor tissue or different clinical characteristics.\n\nA weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to acquire co-expressed genes and co-expression modules according to the expression profiles of these genes. A soft threshold of nine was selected to screen the co-expression modules, ensuring the constructed co-expression network approached a scale-free distribution. The expression matrix was converted into an adjacency matrix and then into a topological overlap matrix (TOM). Average linkage hierarchical clustering was used to cluster genes based on TOM, with a minimum genome number of 40 for the gene dendrogram.\n\nThe Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to optimize the data, resulting in the identification of eight genes for further use. These genes were used to build a prognostic risk score model, with the formula:\n\nRiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 − 0.8828 × MAP2K7 − 0.2654 × PIK3R3 − 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1\n\nThe TCGA training set was used to test whether the gene markers were independent prognostic factors, employing multivariate Cox regression analysis. The timeROC package in R was used to depict the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Samples in the high (H) set had a significantly higher score compared to those in the low (L) set, where \"0\" was used to divide the two sets. A Kaplan–Meier (KM) curve was drawn, with significance defined as P < 0.05.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was initially reduced from 17 to 8. This selection was achieved through the use of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to optimize the data. The final eight genes identified for the prognostic risk score model are RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1. These genes were chosen based on their significance in dividing the samples into high-risk and low-risk groups, as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. The risk score model formula incorporates these eight genes, each with a specific coefficient, to calculate the risk score for individual samples.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the optimization process consisted of eight specific genes. These genes were identified through a series of analytical steps, including univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression, followed by optimization using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The selected genes are RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1. Feature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using only the training set to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting and ensures that the selected features are truly representative of the underlying biological processes.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method involved a systematic approach to identify and validate a prognostic risk score model using gene expression data. Initially, a univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on the training set to identify genes significantly associated with survival, with a threshold of p < 0.01. This step helped in reducing the number of genes from the initial pool, ensuring that only the most relevant genes were considered for further analysis.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, given the number of genes initially considered, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis was employed. This technique is effective in reducing the number of genes by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients, thereby selecting a more parsimonious model. Following Lasso regression, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was utilized to further optimize the data, resulting in the final selection of eight genes. This multi-step process helped in mitigating over-fitting by ensuring that the model was not overly complex and that it generalized well to unseen data.\n\nThe risk score model was then built using the expression levels of these eight genes, with specific coefficients assigned to each gene based on their contribution to the risk score. The formula for the risk score is:\n\nRiskScore = 0.20799×RGS16 + 0.2492×LYVE1 − 0.8828×MAP2K7 − 0.2654×PIK3R3 − 0.5666×ZNF66 + 0.6486×hnRNPC + 0.7821×ANP32A + 0.5284×AIMP1\n\nTo validate the model and ensure it was not under-fitting, the risk scores were calculated for the training set, and the distribution of these scores was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were generated to compare the overall survival (OS) time between high-risk and low-risk groups, with a significant difference observed (p < 0.0001). Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated using the timeROC package to analyze the prognosis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.77, respectively. These steps confirmed that the model was robust and capable of accurately predicting patient outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the model's robustness was verified using an external dataset (GSE41613), where similar results were obtained, reinforcing the model's generalizability and reducing the likelihood of under-fitting. The risk scores were also utilized to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their z-scores, with significant differences in survival time observed between these groups. This comprehensive approach ensured that the model was neither over-fitted nor under-fitted, providing reliable prognostic predictions.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our prognostic risk model. Initially, we used univariate Cox regression analysis to identify genes significantly associated with survival, setting a stringent threshold of p < 0.01. This step helped in filtering out genes that might not have a strong prognostic value, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFollowing this, we applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) regression analysis. Lasso is a regularization method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It does this by adding a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\nAfter reducing the number of genes to 17 using Lasso, we further optimized the model using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. It deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model. By minimizing AIC, we aimed to find the model that best explains the data with the fewest number of parameters, thus preventing overfitting.\n\nThese steps collectively ensured that our final model, which included eight genes, was robust and generalizable to new data. The use of these regularization techniques helped in building a prognostic risk score model that is reliable and not overly complex.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black box; it is designed to be interpretable and transparent. The prognostic risk score model is built using eight specific genes: RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1. Each of these genes contributes to the risk score with a specific coefficient, indicating its weight in the model. The formula for the risk score is explicit:\n\nRiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 − 0.8828 × MAP2K7 − 0.2654 × PIK3R3 − 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1\n\nThis transparency allows for a clear understanding of how each gene influences the overall risk score. For instance, high expression of RGS16, LYVE1, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1 are associated with higher risk, while high expression of ZNF66, PIK3R3, and MAP2K7 are protective factors. This interpretability is crucial for clinical applications, as it provides insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the prognostic predictions. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis, further enhancing its interpretability and reliability.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a prognostic risk score model, which is a type of regression model. It is used to predict the overall survival (OS) time of patients based on the expression levels of eight specific genes. The risk score is calculated using a formula that assigns weights to each of the eight genes, and the resulting score is used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The model's performance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which showed that the model could significantly stratify patients into different risk groups with varying survival outcomes.\n\nThe risk score formula is as follows:\n\nRiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 - 0.8828 × MAP2K7 - 0.2654 × PIK3R3 - 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1\n\nThe model was built using a training set of TCGA samples and was validated using a test set from the same database and an external dataset (GSE41613). The results showed that the model had good prognostic value, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.77 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively, in the training set. The model was also found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis.\n\nThe risk score was further used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their z-scores. Patients with a z-score greater than zero were classified as high-risk, while those with a z-score less than zero were classified as low-risk. The survival time between the high-risk and low-risk groups was found to be significantly different (p < 0.0001).\n\nIn addition to the risk score, the model also considered various clinical features, such as tumor stage, node stage, disease stage, grade, gender, age, alcohol status, HPV status, and smoking status. The results showed that the risk score was significantly correlated with survival in both univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, indicating that it is a robust prognostic factor. The model's performance was also consistent across different clinical subgroups, further validating its prognostic value.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and reliability. Initially, the dataset was divided into training and test sets using a 0.5:0.5 ratio. The training set was used to identify genes through univariate Cox regression analysis, with a threshold of p < 0.01. This was followed by Lasso regression analysis to reduce the number of genes, resulting in 17 genes. Further optimization using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) narrowed down the selection to eight genes, which were then used to build a prognostic risk score model.\n\nThe risk score model was evaluated using the training set to determine if the gene markers were independent prognostic factors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was employed for this purpose. The model's performance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, which showed that six out of the eight genes significantly divided the samples into high-risk and low-risk groups. The risk score of the training set was calculated based on the expression level of each sample, and the distribution of the risk score was analyzed. The overall survival (OS) time of patients with high risk scores was found to be significantly lower than those with low risk scores.\n\nAdditionally, the timeROC package was used to analyze the prognosis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. The model exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74 for 1-year, 0.78 for 3-year, and 0.77 for 5-year survival rates, indicating good prognostic performance. The risk score was also utilized to categorize samples into high-risk and low-risk groups, with 118 high-risk samples and 128 low-risk samples obtained. The survival time between these groups was significantly different (p < 0.0001).\n\nTo further verify the robustness of the model, the risk score was calculated in an independent test set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and an external dataset (GSE41613). This evaluation ensured that the model's performance was consistent across different datasets, providing strong evidence of its reliability and generalizability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic risk score model, several performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness and robustness. The primary metrics used were the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which were calculated for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. These AUC values provide a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk patients.\n\nFor the training set, the model exhibited an AUC of 0.74 for 1-year survival, 0.78 for 3-year survival, and 0.77 for 5-year survival. These values indicate a strong discriminatory power of the model. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these AUC values were provided, further supporting the reliability of these estimates.\n\nTo verify the model's robustness, we also calculated the riskscore in an external dataset (GSE41613). The average AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in this dataset were close to 0.67, demonstrating consistent performance across different datasets.\n\nFurthermore, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were used to analyze the survival time between high-risk and low-risk groups. The survival time between these groups was found to be significantly different (p < 0.0001), reinforcing the model's prognostic value.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The riskscore was found to be significantly correlated with survival in both univariate (HR = 1.913, p = 2.0E-16) and multivariate (HR = 1.872, p = 2.0E-16) analyses, indicating that the riskscore is an independent prognostic factor.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in similar contexts. The use of AUC values, KM curves, and Cox regression analyses provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's discriminatory power, robustness, and prognostic value.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the 8-mRNAsi based signature model included several performance metrics with confidence intervals. For instance, the area under the curve (AUC) for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, the 1-year AUC was 0.74 with a 95% CI of 0.66–0.81, the 3-year AUC was 0.78 with a 95% CI of 0.72–0.84, and the 5-year AUC was 0.77 with a 95% CI of 0.69–0.85. These intervals provide a range within which the true AUC values are likely to fall, indicating the reliability of the model's performance estimates.\n\nStatistical significance was also a key aspect of the evaluation. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves showed that the survival time between high and low-risk groups was significantly different, with a p-value of less than 0.0001. This strong statistical significance suggests that the model effectively stratifies patients into distinct risk groups.\n\nAdditionally, the risk score was found to be a significant prognostic factor in both univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. The hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported, showing significant correlations with survival outcomes. For example, the risk score had an HR of 1.913 (95% CI 1.642-2.228, p = 2.0E-16) in univariable analysis and an HR of 1.872 (95% CI 1.613-2.173, p = 2.0E-16) in multivariable analysis. These results indicate that the risk score is a robust and independent prognostic factor.\n\nThe model's performance was further validated using an external dataset (GSE41613), where the average 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs were close to 0.67, demonstrating consistent performance across different datasets. The survival time between high and low-risk samples in the external dataset was also significantly different, reinforcing the model's reliability.\n\nOverall, the evaluation confidence is high due to the inclusion of confidence intervals for performance metrics, strong statistical significance in survival analysis, and consistent results across multiple datasets.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw data utilized in this study is publicly available. The gene expression and clinical information of HNSCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website. Specifically, 546 RNA-Seq expression data samples were downloaded. Additionally, 97 cases of GSE41613 data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. The data from these sources underwent preprocessing to ensure consistency and relevance for the analysis. The preprocessing steps included retaining samples with expression profile information, converting Ensemble IDs to Gene Symbols, and focusing on protein-coding genes. For the TCGA data, only primary solid tumors and solid normal tissue samples were retained, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were removed from the overall survival (OS) data used for survival analysis. Similar preprocessing steps were applied to the GSE41613 data, including converting the unit of survival information to days and removing samples with a survival time of less than 30 days. All data from these two databases after preprocessing are detailed in the provided tables. The data is available under the terms and conditions specified by TCGA and GEO, which typically include appropriate citation and compliance with their data usage policies."
