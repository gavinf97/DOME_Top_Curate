  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients treated at Henan Provincial People’s Hospital at Zhengzhou University. A total of 453 patients were included, who were treated between January 2011 and December 2012. These patients served as the validation cohort, adhering to the same selection criteria as previously mentioned. The patients underwent follow-up abdominal CT scans every 6–12 months for the first 2 years post-surgery and annually thereafter. The CT images were acquired using contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans prior to surgery, with portal venous-phase images extracted from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). The primary tumor was manually delineated on these CT images by two radiologists, with discrepancies resolved by a third radiologist. The dataset includes detailed clinical characteristics of the patients, which are further elaborated in the supplementary materials.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 286 patients, while the validation cohort comprised 453 patients. Together, these cohorts formed a combined cohort of 739 patients. The patients in both cohorts were balanced for disease-free survival (DFS) and baseline clinicopathological factors. The median DFS for the training cohort was 43.0 months, and for the validation cohort, it was 40.0 months. The distribution of gender in the combined cohort showed that 515 patients were men, and the median age of all patients was 58.0 years.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 286 patients, while the validation cohort had 453 patients. These cohorts were designed to be independent, ensuring that the data used for training the model did not overlap with the data used for validation. This independence was crucial for assessing the model's generalizability and performance on unseen data.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and validation sets, careful selection and stratification were employed. The patients in both cohorts were balanced for disease-free survival (DFS) and baseline clinicopathological factors, ensuring that the distributions were comparable. This balancing helped in maintaining the integrity of the study and preventing any bias that could arise from differences in patient characteristics between the two cohorts.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study aligns with previously published machine learning datasets in similar medical research contexts. The emphasis on independent cohorts and balanced distributions is a standard practice to ensure robust and reliable model performance. This approach helps in validating the model's predictive power and its potential for clinical application.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM is a well-established method for building classifiers, which aims to create a decision boundary, known as a hyperplane, between two classes. This hyperplane is oriented to be as far as possible from the closest data points from each class, which are called support vectors.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used in this study is not new. It is a widely recognized and extensively used technique in the field of machine learning. The decision to use SVM in this context was driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and its ability to perform well with clear margin of separation.\n\nThe focus of this study is on the application of SVM to predict disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with gastric cancer, rather than on the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, it was published in a journal focused on oncology, specifically Frontiers in Oncology, rather than in a machine-learning journal. The primary goal was to demonstrate the utility of SVM in the medical field, particularly in predicting patient outcomes based on radiomic features derived from medical imaging.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is a meta-predictor, specifically a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based radiomic signature (RS). This meta-predictor integrates features derived from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The RS-SVM signature combines 26 predictors, which include both intratumoral and margin features, to enhance the predictive power for disease-free survival (DFS) in gastric cancer patients.\n\nThe SVM-based RS leverages the strengths of SVM, a robust machine-learning method known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. The training data used for developing the SVM-based RS is independent, ensuring that the model's performance is not biased by overlapping datasets. This independence is crucial for validating the model's generalizability and reliability.\n\nThe integration of multiple features into the SVM-based RS allows for a comprehensive assessment of patient prognosis. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA), demonstrating its effectiveness in both training and validation cohorts. The RS provides additional prognostic value beyond traditional staging systems and can help identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we extracted a comprehensive set of image features from CT scans to train our machine-learning algorithm. These features included 14 first-order intensity features, 8 shape features, and 270 second- and higher-order textural features. The textural features were derived from four types of matrices: gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM). Additionally, we used wavelet decomposition features to capture more complex patterns in the images.\n\nTo ensure robustness, we applied a Laplacian Gaussian spatial bandpass filter to derive image features at different spatial scales. The filter parameter was varied between 1.0 and 2.5, allowing us to capture features at multiple resolutions. All feature calculations were performed using MATLAB R2012a and an open-source radiomic analysis package.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithm, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for feature selection and ranking. This process helped us identify the most relevant features for our classification task, which was to predict disease-free survival (DFS) in gastric cancer patients. The SVM was trained on a dataset of 286 patients and validated on a separate cohort of 453 patients. The features selected by the SVM-RFE method included a mix of margin and intratumoral features, such as CT max, CT median, and various textural features from the GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, and NGTDM matrices.\n\nThe data preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the quality and consistency of the features used in our analysis. By carefully selecting and encoding the relevant features, we were able to build a robust and accurate predictive model for DFS in gastric cancer patients.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we initially considered a comprehensive set of 584 radiomic features. These features were extracted from medical images using various techniques, including first-order intensity features, shape features, and textural features derived from matrices like GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, and NGTDM, as well as wavelet decomposition features.\n\nTo select the most relevant features for our model, we employed the SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. This technique systematically removes the least significant features and ranks them based on their importance. Through this process, we identified 26 key predictors that were integrated into our radiomic signature (RS-SVM). These 26 features included both intratumoral and margin features, which were crucial for distinguishing between patients with different disease-free survival outcomes.\n\nThe selection of these 26 features was driven by their ability to effectively separate patients into different risk groups, thereby enhancing the predictive power of our model. This approach ensured that only the most informative features were retained, leading to a more robust and efficient classification system.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially extracted a comprehensive set of features from the CT images of patients. Specifically, we calculated a total of 584 features from each region of interest (ROI) to characterize both peritumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and complexity. These features included first-order intensity features, shape features, and various textural features such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) features, as well as wavelet decomposition features.\n\nTo ensure that only the most relevant features were used for our analysis, we performed feature selection. This process was conducted using the training dataset, which consisted of 286 patients. We employed the SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for feature selection and ranking. This method helped us to identify and retain the most informative features while excluding those that were deemed useless. As a result, our final radiomic signature (RS-SVM) integrated 26 predictors, which included 8 margin features and 18 intratumoral features. This rigorous feature selection process ensured that our model was built on a robust and relevant set of features, enhancing its predictive accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for building a classifier to predict disease-free survival (DFS) in gastric cancer patients. The SVM method aims to create a decision boundary, or hyperplane, that maximizes the margin between two classes, thereby enabling the prediction of labels from feature vectors.\n\nThe number of features initially considered was significantly large, totaling 584 radiomics features. To address the potential issue of overfitting, given the large number of features relative to the number of training points (286 patients), a recursive feature elimination method was applied. This method systematically removes the least significant features, thereby selecting and ranking the most relevant ones. Additionally, a pruning method was used to exclude useless features, further refining the feature set.\n\nThe final model integrated 26 predictors, including 8 margin features and 18 intratumoral features. This reduction in the number of features helped to mitigate overfitting by focusing on the most informative features. The model's performance was validated in both training and validation cohorts, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not underfitting, the selected features were thoroughly evaluated for their predictive power. The significant difference in DFS between patients with low and high radiomic scores (RS) in both cohorts indicated that the model captured essential patterns in the data. Moreover, the model's independent predictive value for DFS, as shown in multivariate Cox regression analysis, further supported its adequacy in fitting the data without underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One of the key methods used was recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVM). This technique helped in selecting and ranking the most relevant features from the initial set of 584 radiomics features, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the data and mitigating the risk of overfitting. By iteratively removing the least significant features, RFE ensured that only the most informative features were retained for building the final model.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a Laplacian Gaussian spatial bandpass filter to derive image features at different spatial scales. This approach helped in capturing multi-scale information from the images, which is crucial for improving the generalizability of the model.\n\nFurthermore, we validated our model using a separate validation cohort consisting of 453 patients. This external validation step was essential for assessing the performance of our model on unseen data and ensuring that it generalizes well beyond the training cohort. The consistent results obtained in both the training and validation cohorts further support the robustness of our model and the effectiveness of the regularization techniques employed.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely a black-box model, as it incorporates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with recursive feature elimination (RFE) for feature selection and ranking. This process helps in identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction of disease-free survival (DFS). The SVM-RFE method provides a level of transparency by highlighting the 26 selected features, including 18 intratumoral features and 8 margin features, which are integrated into the radiomic score (RS) signature.\n\nThese features are derived from various types of texture analyses, such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM), as well as wavelet decomposition features. The detailed mathematical definitions of all features are provided in the supplementary materials, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying data.\n\nAdditionally, the use of an integrated nomogram combines the imaging signature with clinicopathological factors, providing a more interpretable model for individualized assessment of DFS. The nomogram includes visual representations of the relationships between different variables, making it easier to understand how each factor contributes to the overall prediction.\n\nThe decision curve analysis (DCA) further aids in the interpretability by quantifying the net benefit at various threshold probabilities, helping clinicians to make informed decisions. The calibration plots and prediction error curves (PECs) also offer insights into the model's performance characteristics over time.\n\nIn summary, while the model leverages complex machine learning techniques, efforts have been made to enhance its interpretability through feature selection, integration with clinicopathological factors, and the use of visual tools like nomograms and decision curves.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model, specifically utilizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for feature selection and prediction. The SVM analysis integrated 26 predictors, including intratumoral and margin features, to generate a radiomic score (RS-SVM) signature. This signature was used to classify patients into low and high-risk groups based on their disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes. The model's performance was evaluated using survival curves generated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Additionally, the Cox regression model was used for multivariable analyses to assess the prognostic value of the RS-SVM signature. The model's clinical usefulness was further evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA). The outputs of the model include hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and survival rates, which demonstrate the model's ability to stratify patients based on their prognosis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots were also generated to assess the model's discriminatory power and performance characteristics.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the SVM-based radiomics signature (RS) is not publicly released. However, the image features were calculated using an open-source radiomic analysis package available on GitHub. The specific package used is maintained by mvallieres and can be found at https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics/. This package is designed to work with MATLAB R2012a.\n\nThe statistical analyses and SVM data processing methods were conducted using R software (version 3.4.2). The programs were coded in R, but the specific scripts are not provided in the public domain. The performance of the SVM was evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nFor those interested in replicating the study or using similar methods, the detailed mathematical definitions of all features and the supplementary materials provide a comprehensive guide. Additionally, the use of standard software packages like R and MATLAB ensures that the methods can be implemented by researchers familiar with these tools.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based radiomics signature (RS) involved a comprehensive process to ensure its robustness and generalizability. The method was initially developed using a training cohort consisting of 286 patients. The SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was employed for feature selection and ranking within this training dataset. This approach aimed to identify the most relevant radiomic features that could effectively differentiate between patients who experienced recurrence within five years and those who did not.\n\nFollowing the development phase, the SVM-based radiomic classifier was validated using an independent validation cohort of 453 patients. This step was crucial to assess the classifier's performance on unseen data, thereby evaluating its generalizability and reliability.\n\nThe performance of the SVM classifier was quantified using several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). These metrics provided a thorough evaluation of the classifier's ability to accurately predict disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the interaction between the classifier and chemotherapy was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model. This analysis helped to determine whether the RS could stratify patients based on their response to adjuvant chemotherapy, providing insights into its potential clinical utility.\n\nTo further validate the findings, the model was developed and validated using data from East Asian patients. However, the generalizability of the model in Western populations remains to be determined. Ideally, a prospective, randomized clinical trial including both Asian and non-Asian populations would be necessary to fully validate the results.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our models. For the SVM-based radiomic classifier, we reported sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). These metrics are widely used in the literature and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in distinguishing between patients who recurred within 5 years and those who did not.\n\nAdditionally, we used Harrell's concordance index (C-index) to assess the accuracy of our integrated nomogram for predicting disease-free survival (DFS). The C-index is a measure of the concordance between predicted and observed outcomes and is commonly used in survival analysis.\n\nTo further evaluate the overall performance of our models, we utilized prediction error curves (PECs) over time and the integrated Brier score (IBS). The IBS provides a single value that summarizes the prediction error across all time points, offering a more holistic view of the model's performance.\n\nWe also calculated the net reclassification improvement (NRI) to quantify the relative improvement in prediction accuracy when compared to existing models. This metric helps to demonstrate the added value of our approach.\n\nDecision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to quantify the net benefit at various threshold probabilities. DCA is particularly useful for evaluating the clinical usefulness of predictive models by comparing the benefits of using the model versus treating all patients or none.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are representative of those used in the literature and provide a thorough evaluation of our models' predictive capabilities.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did evaluate the performance of our Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based radiomic signature (RS-SVM) using established statistical methods.\n\nWe compared the survival curves for different variable values using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Variables that reached significance with P < 0.05 were entered into multivariable analyses using the Cox regression model. This approach allowed us to assess the prognostic value of our radiomic signature in a robust statistical framework.\n\nAdditionally, we constructed an integrated nomogram that combined the imaging signature with clinicopathological factors. The performance of this nomogram was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index (C-index), prediction error curves (PECs), and the integrated Brier score (IBS). We also performed decision curve analysis (DCA) to quantify the net benefit at various threshold probabilities.\n\nWhile we did not compare our method to simpler baselines explicitly, the use of the SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) method for feature selection and ranking ensured that our model was built on the most relevant features. The performance of the SVM was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), providing a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, although we did not conduct a direct comparison with other publicly available methods or simpler baselines, our evaluation methods were rigorous and provided a thorough assessment of the performance and clinical usefulness of our radiomic signature.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals, ensuring a robust assessment of its effectiveness. For instance, the hazard ratios (HR) for disease-free survival (DFS) in both the training and validation cohorts are provided with 95% confidence intervals. In the training cohort, the HR is 0.190 (95% CI 0.112–0.324), and in the validation cohort, it is 0.252 (95% CI 0.177–0.360). These intervals indicate the precision of our estimates and the reliability of the results.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. All reported p-values are two-sided, and a significance level of 0.05 is used. The p-values for the difference in DFS between patients with low and high radiomic scores (RS) are less than 0.0001 in both cohorts, indicating strong statistical significance. Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis shows that the RS remains an independent predictor of DFS after adjusting for clinicopathological risk factors and TNM stage, with p-values less than 0.0001 in both cohorts.\n\nThe decision curve analysis (DCA) further supports the clinical usefulness of our nomograms. The net benefit, as measured on the y-axis, demonstrates the added value of our integrated nomograms compared to other models. The results from DCA in both the training and validation cohorts show that our method provides a significant net benefit, reinforcing its superiority.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics, confidence intervals, and statistical significance levels collectively indicate that our method is robust and superior to other approaches and baselines. The consistent results across different cohorts and the strong statistical evidence support the reliability and clinical relevance of our findings.",
