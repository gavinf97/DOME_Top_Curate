  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in our study primarily involves several machine learning techniques to construct a prognostic signature centered around METTL5. We employed Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to assess the prognostic significance of METTL5. To develop an effective predictive signature, we utilized an evolutionary analysis implemented in the R package Spathial. This package employs the Principal Path algorithm to identify genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. The Principal Path algorithm helps in finding the most important genes involved in a certain process by stratifying samples into two groups based on the upper and lower quantiles of METTL5 expression.\n\nFollowing this, we used a random survival forest to further reduce the number of features. This method, implemented in the R package randomForestSRC, helps in selecting the top genes based on their variable importance (VIMP). The random survival forest was trained with specific parameters to ensure the stability and accuracy of the model.\n\nFinally, we constructed the METTL5-associated prognostic signature (MAPS) through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. This technique, performed with 10-fold cross-validation, helps in selecting the optimal set of genes and their corresponding coefficients. The MAPS was calculated using a formula that incorporates the coefficients of the selected genes and their normalized expression values.\n\nThe algorithms used are well-established in the field of machine learning and bioinformatics, and they were chosen for their robustness and applicability to survival analysis and feature selection in high-dimensional data. The focus of our study is on the biological and clinical implications of METTL5 in lung adenocarcinoma, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the methods were published in a genetics journal rather than a machine-learning journal.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is a meta-predictor, as it integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive efficacy. The process begins with a Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to assess the prognostic significance of METTL5. Following this, an evolutionary analysis using the Principal Path algorithm identifies genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. Samples are stratified into two groups based on METTL5 expression, and the Principal Path algorithm is employed to find the most important genes involved in this process.\n\nThe top 100 genes selected from this analysis are then input into a random survival forest to further reduce the number of features. The random survival forest helps in ranking genes by their variable importance (VIMP), and the top 15 genes are selected for penalized regression analysis. Finally, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression is applied to construct the METTL5-associated prognostic signature (MAPS). The optimal parameter for LASSO is determined through 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nThe training data for each step is independent, ensuring that the model's performance is robust and generalizable. The random survival forest and LASSO regression are trained on different subsets of the data, and the final signature is validated in three independent cohorts, demonstrating its predictive ability across different datasets. This multi-step approach ensures that the model leverages the strengths of various machine learning techniques to provide a comprehensive and accurate prognostic signature.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal performance. The multi-omics dataset, which included mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, gene mutation, and copy number variation (CNV) data, was retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal. For the TCGA-LUAD cohort, duplicated samples were removed, and only samples with complete transcriptome data and survival information were included for model training. This ensured that the dataset was clean and relevant for the analysis.\n\nThe mRNA expression data, originally in Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) format, was converted to Transcripts Per Million (TPM) to standardize the expression levels. This conversion is crucial for comparing expression data across different samples and experiments.\n\nDNA methylation status was quantified using beta values, which represent the ratio of the intensity of the methylated signal to the sum of the intensities of the methylated and unmethylated signals. This provides a continuous measure of methylation levels.\n\nCopy number variations were quantified using the GISTIC2 method, which identifies significant regions of copy number alteration in the genome. This method helps in identifying genes that are amplified or deleted in cancer samples, providing insights into potential drivers of the disease.\n\nAdditionally, the Human Protein Atlas was employed to display the distribution and intensity of the METTL5 protein in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and normal lung tissue. This visual representation helped in understanding the expression patterns of METTL5 at the protein level.\n\nThese preprocessing steps ensured that the data was standardized, clean, and ready for the machine-learning algorithms used in the study. The algorithms included Cox regression, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, Principal Path algorithm, random survival forests, and LASSO regression, all of which required well-preprocessed data for accurate and reliable results.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a multi-step feature selection procedure. Initially, a principal path algorithm was employed to identify genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. This resulted in the selection of the top 100 genes based on their significance.\n\nSubsequently, a random survival forest was used to further reduce the number of features. The top 15 genes were selected according to their variable importance (VIMP). Finally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed with 10-fold cross-validation to construct the prognostic signature. This process ultimately included five candidate genes in the final model. The optimal parameter λ for the LASSO regression was set to 0.038, ensuring that the model was both parsimonious and predictive.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was indeed performed to enhance the predictive efficacy of the prognostic signature. Initially, a large set of genes was considered, but this was systematically reduced to identify the most relevant features.\n\nThe process began with the application of the Principal Path algorithm to find genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. This algorithm helped in identifying the most important genes involved in the process. Samples were stratified into two groups based on the upper and lower quantiles of METTL5 expression, and the top 100 genes were selected based on their significance.\n\nNext, a random survival forest was employed to further reduce the number of features. This method ranked genes by their variable importance (VIMP), and the top 15 genes were selected for further analysis. This step ensured that only the most relevant genes were considered, thereby improving the model's predictive power.\n\nFinally, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed using 10-fold cross-validation on these selected genes. This step ultimately led to the inclusion of five candidate genes in the final prognostic signature. These genes were METTL5, RAC1, RCCD1, C11orf24, and SLC7A5.\n\nThroughout this process, feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance was not biased by information from the validation cohorts. This rigorous approach helped in constructing a robust and reliable prognostic signature.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved several machine learning algorithms to construct a prognostic signature centered around METTL5. The process began with the application of the Principal Path algorithm to identify genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. This algorithm helped in finding the most important genes involved in the process by setting the starting and ending points of the path as centroids of the two groups stratified by METTL5 expression.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the high dimensionality of the data compared to the number of training points, a random survival forest was used. This method helped in reducing the number of features by ranking gene significances based on variable importance (VIMP). The top 15 genes were selected for further analysis, ensuring that only the most relevant features were considered.\n\nSubsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed with 10-fold cross-validation to construct the final prognostic signature. This technique is effective in handling high-dimensional data by imposing a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients, which helps in selecting a parsimonious model and mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The C-index quantifies the predictive accuracy of the model, while the ROC curves assess the model's ability to discriminate between different risk groups. The area under the curve (AUC) values for 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were reported, indicating the model's predictive power.\n\nAdditionally, the model was validated in three independent cohorts, further confirming its robustness and generalizability. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and univariate Cox regression analyses in these cohorts provided additional evidence of the model's prognostic value. The consistent performance across multiple datasets suggests that the model is neither overfitted nor underfitted, but rather well-calibrated to the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the optimization process of our prognostic signature, several regularization methods were employed to prevent overfitting. Initially, a random survival forest was used to reduce the number of features by selecting the top 15 genes based on their variable importance. This step helped in filtering out less relevant genes, thereby simplifying the model and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nSubsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied. LASSO is a powerful technique for feature selection and regularization, as it imposes a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero. This process not only simplifies the model by selecting a subset of the most relevant genes but also helps in preventing overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.\n\nThe optimal parameter for LASSO was determined through 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the model's performance was robust and generalizable to unseen data. This cross-validation technique further helped in mitigating overfitting by providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the study does mention the use of specific machine learning algorithms and statistical methods, such as Cox regression, random survival forest, and LASSO regression, which were implemented using R packages like Spathial, randomForestSRC, and survcomp. The parameters for these methods were set according to default values or specific settings mentioned in the text, such as the number of waypoints in the Principal Path algorithm and the settings for the random survival forest.\n\nThe optimization parameters for these algorithms are not fully reported, but the study does provide details on the methods used for feature selection and model construction. For instance, the METTL5-associated prognostic signature (MAPS) was constructed through LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal parameter. The formula for calculating MAPS is also provided, which includes the coefficients of the selected genes and their normalized expression values.\n\nRegarding the availability of the data and code, the study mentions that publicly available datasets were analyzed, specifically from the TCGA and GEO repositories. The datasets used in the current study can be found in these repositories. However, the specific model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly made available in the text. The study does not provide information on the license under which the data or code might be shared.\n\nIn summary, while the study provides details on the methods and some parameters used for optimization, the specific hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not fully reported or made available. The data used in the study can be accessed from public repositories, but the code and detailed optimization parameters are not explicitly shared.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study, known as MAPS, is not a black-box model. Instead, it is designed to be interpretable and transparent. The construction of MAPS involved several steps that ensure its interpretability.\n\nFirst, the Principal Path algorithm was used to identify genes associated with METTL5. This algorithm helps in visualizing the selected path and data points in a dimensionality reduction manner, making it easier to understand the relationships between METTL5 and other genes.\n\nNext, a random survival forest model was employed to quantify the Out-of-Bag (OOB) prediction error. This step helped in selecting the top 15 genes based on their Variable Importance in the Projection (VIMP) scores. The ranking of these genes according to minimal depth was also illustrated, providing a clear understanding of their significance in the model.\n\nFurthermore, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression was performed using 10-fold cross-validation on the selected genes. This process identified five candidate genes—METTL5, RAC1, RCCD1, C11orf24, and SLC7A5—that were included in the final prognostic model. The coefficients for each gene in the model were clearly defined, allowing for an understanding of their individual contributions to the risk score.\n\nThe final MAPS score is calculated using a formula that includes the expression levels of these five genes, weighted by their respective coefficients. This formula provides a transparent way to assess the risk for each patient, making it easier for clinicians to interpret the results and make informed decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was validated in three independent cohorts, and the results were presented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and ROC curves. These visualizations help in understanding the model's predictive power and its clinical utility.\n\nIn summary, the MAPS model is designed to be transparent and interpretable. The use of algorithms like Principal Path and LASSO regression, along with clear visualizations and defined coefficients, ensures that the model's decisions can be understood and trusted by clinicians and researchers.",
  "model/output": "The model constructed in this study is a prognostic model, specifically designed for survival analysis, which is a type of regression task. It aims to predict the overall survival time of patients with lung adenocarcinoma based on gene expression profiles. The model, named MAPS (METTL5-Associated Prognostic Signature), was developed using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Principal Path, random survival forests, and LASSO Cox regression. The final model includes five genes: METTL5, RAC1, RCCD1, C11orf24, and SLC7A5. The risk score, or MACS (METTL5-Associated Cancer Score), is calculated using the expression levels of these genes, weighted by their respective coefficients. Patients are then stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the median MACS. The model's performance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and ROC curves, demonstrating its prognostic value in multiple cohorts.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model construction process involved several steps. Initially, the Principal Path algorithm was employed to identify genes associated with different expression levels of METTL5. This process included setting up the path with 50 waypoints and ranking gene significances by adjusted P values, which was computationally intensive but efficient given the dataset size.\n\nFollowing this, a random survival forest was used to further reduce the number of features. The training process, with parameters set to \"importance = TRUE\" and \"block size = 1,\" required running multiple trees to achieve stable prediction accuracy. The error plot indicated that the prediction accuracy stabilized around 375 trees, which took a considerable amount of time due to the iterative nature of the algorithm.\n\nSubsequently, LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation was performed on the top 15 genes ranked by variable importance. This step involved determining the optimal lambda value, which required multiple iterations and cross-validation folds, adding to the overall execution time.\n\nIn summary, while specific execution times for each step were not explicitly mentioned, the model construction process was comprehensive and involved several computationally intensive steps, including dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and regression analysis. The total execution time would depend on the computational resources available and the efficiency of the algorithms implemented.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and predictive efficacy. Initially, a METTL5-centered prognostic signature was constructed using the TCGA-LUAD cohort. This signature was developed through a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Cox regression, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and random survival forests. The optimal threshold for grouping was determined using the maximally selected rank statistics. The signature was further refined using LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation to select the most relevant genes.\n\nTo validate the predictive value of the signature, it was tested in three independent cohorts obtained from GEO: GSE3141, GSE13213, and GSE31210. In these cohorts, the signature was calculated for each sample, and the median of the signature scores served as the cutoff value for stratification. Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis were performed to assess the prognostic significance of the signature in these independent datasets. Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models were implemented to control for confounders, given the more complete clinical information available in these datasets.\n\nThe prognostic value of the signature was further evaluated using ROC curves, which provided area under the curve (AUC) values for 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival. These evaluations demonstrated the signature's ability to predict patient outcomes effectively. Furthermore, the signature's biological relevance was explored through functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, to understand the potential biological roles of the genes involved. The tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration were also assessed using the ESTIMATE algorithm and Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI), respectively. This comprehensive evaluation ensured that the signature's predictive efficacy and biological relevance were thoroughly validated.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the predictive efficacy of our METTL5-associated prognostic signature (MAPS) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The primary metrics used were the concordance index (C-index) and the restricted mean survival (RMS) curve.\n\nThe C-index is a measure of the concordance between predicted and observed survival times, with values ranging from 0.5 (no predictive power) to 1 (perfect prediction). We compared the C-index of MAPS with that of a published m6A prognostic signature in multiple cohorts, including the TCGA-LUAD cohort, GSE31210, and GSE3141. MAPS demonstrated superior predictive performance with higher C-index values in all datasets.\n\nThe RMS curve was used to present the life expectancy of different risk groups at 120 months. A larger slope of the RMS curves indicated a superior predictive performance. In our comparisons, the slope of the MAPS curve was greater than that of the published model in all three datasets, further confirming the superior predictive ability of MAPS.\n\nAdditionally, we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox regression to validate the prognostic value of MAPS in independent cohorts. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) for 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) were also calculated to evaluate the predictive power of MAPS. The AUCs were 0.527, 0.596, and 0.671, respectively, indicating a reasonable predictive accuracy.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in cancer research, ensuring that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we compared the performance of our developed model, MAPS, with other existing methods to evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we compared MAPS with a published m6A prognostic signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This comparison was conducted across multiple cohorts, including the TCGA-LUAD cohort and two independent datasets (GSE31210 and GSE3141).\n\nTo quantify and compare the prognostic value of these models, we used the concordance index (C-index) and the restricted mean survival (RMS) curve. The C-index provides a measure of the model's predictive accuracy, while the RMS curve illustrates the life expectancy of different risk groups at 120 months. A larger slope in the RMS curves indicates superior predictive performance.\n\nThe results showed that MAPS demonstrated significant improvement in predictive efficacy compared to the m6A signature. For instance, in the TCGA-LUAD cohort, the C-index for MAPS was 0.64, whereas it was 0.58 for the m6A signature, with a p-value of 0.011. Similarly, in the GSE31210 dataset, the C-index for MAPS was 0.71 compared to 0.56 for the m6A signature, with a p-value of less than 0.001. In the GSE3141 dataset, the C-index for MAPS was 0.65 compared to 0.50 for the m6A signature, with a p-value of 0.006. These findings were further supported by the slope of the RMS curves, which was greater for MAPS in all three datasets, confirming its superior predictive performance.\n\nAdditionally, we performed a comparison with simpler baselines, such as univariate Cox regression models, to ensure that the complexity of MAPS was justified by its improved performance. These comparisons validated that MAPS not only outperformed existing methods but also provided a more robust and reliable prognostic tool for LUAD.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method, the METTL5-associated prognostic signature (MAPS), includes several statistical analyses to ensure confidence in the results. We used the concordance index (C-index) to quantify and compare the prognostic value of MAPS with a published m6A-prognostic signature. The C-index values for MAPS were significantly higher than those of the m6A signature across multiple cohorts, with P-values indicating statistical significance (e.g., P = 0.011 in the TCGA-LUAD cohort, P < 0.001 in GSE31210, and P = 0.006 in GSE3141). These P-values suggest that the differences in performance are not due to random chance.\n\nAdditionally, we employed the restricted mean survival (RMS) curve to present the life expectancy of different risk groups at 120 months. The slope of the RMS curves for MAPS was greater than that of the m6A signature in all three datasets, further indicating superior predictive performance.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using a P-value threshold of less than 0.05. We conducted Wilcoxon and Kruskal–Wallis tests for continuous variables, Pearson’s correlations for associations between variables, and Cox regression and Log-rank tests for survival analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate predictive efficacy, and the C-index was calculated and compared using specific packages in R.\n\nOverall, the statistical analyses and significance tests provide a robust framework for evaluating the performance of MAPS, ensuring that the claims of superiority over other models and baselines are well-supported.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in this study are publicly available. The datasets collected for this research can be found in the TCGA and GEO repositories. These repositories are widely accessible and provide a wealth of genomic data for various cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma. The TCGA dataset includes multi-omics profiles such as mRNA expression, DNA methylation, gene mutation, and copy number variation data. The GEO repository contains microarray datasets that were used for validation purposes. Both repositories offer comprehensive datasets that can be utilized by researchers for further analysis and validation of findings.
