  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO-RA). This registry includes data from patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs). The data collection period spanned from December 2012 to June 2019, during which a total of 2122 patients were registered.\n\nTo focus on the specific aim of predicting responses to bDMARDs, patients treated with tsDMARDs, such as tofacitinib, were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, rituximab was excluded due to its small sample size. Furthermore, data from subjects with follow-up durations of less than 3 months from the baseline were also excluded. As a result, the final dataset consisted of 1204 baseline data points and 1397 follow-up data points.\n\nThe dataset has been utilized in this study to develop and validate machine learning models for predicting remission in patients receiving bDMARDs. The models were trained and tested using this dataset, with a focus on avoiding overfitting and ensuring the robustness of the predictions. The dataset includes a variety of clinical variables that are relevant to the prescription of biologics and the response to treatment.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a test set. The ratio used for this split was 7:3, meaning 70% of the data was used for training the models, and 30% was reserved for testing their performance.\n\nFor the training dataset, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed. This technique involves dividing the training data into five subsets, or \"folds.\" The model is then trained on four of these folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. This approach helps in tuning the hyperparameters and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nThe specific number of data points in each split is not explicitly mentioned, but the overall dataset consisted of 1204 baseline data points and 1397 follow-up data points. The distribution of data points in each fold during cross-validation would be approximately equal, given the nature of 5-fold cross-validation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "To avoid overfitting problems, the datasets were divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. The models were trained using the training set, and the prediction results were verified using the test set. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, which is crucial for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nTo further enhance the robustness of the models, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. This process involved dividing the training data into five subsets, training the model on four of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This procedure was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This method helps in tuning the hyperparameters and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\nAdditionally, bootstrapping was employed to obtain a more reliable estimate of the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. Bootstrapping involves random sampling with replacement from the training set, which helps in reducing measurement variances caused by small sample sizes when dividing between the training and test sets.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of rheumatoid arthritis research. The datasets include a comprehensive set of variables known to be of clinical importance, such as sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and five comorbidities. These variables were preselected based on their frequent use in clinical practice for prescribing biologics.\n\nFurthermore, 20 additional variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) were selected. This resulted in a fixed set of 35 variables used for creating the prediction models. This approach ensures that the datasets are robust and representative of the clinical scenarios, making the models more reliable and applicable in real-world settings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study are not publicly available. They are managed by the Clinical Research Committee of KOBIO under the Korean College of Rheumatology. Researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data can request the data. To do so, they should contact Kichul Shin, MD, PhD, Director of the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry. The contact information provided includes an address, telephone number, fax number, and email address. The data access process is enforced through this committee, ensuring that only qualified researchers with legitimate purposes can obtain the data.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study belong to the class of supervised learning models, specifically designed for classification tasks. The algorithms employed include lasso and ridge regression, support vector machine using kernel methods, tree-based random forest, and Xgboost. These are well-established algorithms in the field of machine learning and have been extensively used in various predictive modeling tasks.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new; they have been previously published and are widely recognized in the machine learning community. Lasso and ridge regression are linear models that incorporate regularization to prevent overfitting. Support vector machines are powerful tools for classification tasks, particularly when the data is not linearly separable. Random forests and Xgboost are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their ability to capture non-linear relationships between variables. The study focused on predicting remission in subjects receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and non-TNF inhibitors. Given the complexity of the data and the need for accurate predictions, these algorithms were selected for their robustness and interpretability.\n\nThe algorithms were implemented using established packages in R, such as the caret package for model training and the SHAPforxgboost package for interpretability. The use of these packages ensured that the models were trained and validated using standard practices in the field of machine learning.\n\nThe study did not introduce a new machine-learning algorithm, but rather applied existing algorithms to a specific medical context. The focus was on leveraging these algorithms to provide insights into the factors that influence remission in patients receiving bDMARDs. The results of the study highlight the importance of certain clinical features in predicting remission, which can inform clinical decision-making and improve treatment outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs five distinct machine learning models to predict remission in subjects receiving various treatments. These models include lasso, ridge, support vector machine using kernel methods, tree-based random forest, and Xgboost. Each model was trained and tested independently using a 7:3 ratio split of the dataset, with a 5-fold cross-validation performed on the training dataset to tune hyperparameters. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, and bootstrapping was used to determine the accuracy and reduce measurement variances caused by small samples. The training data for each model is independent, as the dataset was split into training and test sets before model training.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the models could effectively learn from the dataset. Missing data for variables were handled by replacing them with the median value for each variable. This approach was chosen to maintain the central tendency of the data while minimizing the impact of outliers.\n\nBinary variables, such as comorbidities, were coded as 1 if present (\"yes\") and 0 if absent (\"no\" or \"no test\"). This binary encoding simplified the data, making it easier for the models to interpret and process. The choice of \"no\" as the most common value for binary encoding was based on the frequency of occurrences in the dataset.\n\nDimension reduction was performed to address the \"curse of dimensionality,\" which can occur when the number of variables is large compared to the size of the data. Initially, 64 variables were considered. To focus on clinically relevant features, variables frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescribing biologics were selected, while those not referenced in prescribing decisions were excluded. This resulted in a preselection of 15 clinically important variables, including sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and five comorbidities.\n\nAdditionally, 20 variables highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) were selected. After this variable selection process, a fixed set of 35 variables was used to create the prediction models. This approach ensured that the models were trained on a manageable and clinically relevant set of features, enhancing their predictive performance and interpretability.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of 35 variables as input parameters for our machine learning models. The selection process for these variables was meticulous and involved several steps to ensure that only the most relevant and clinically significant features were included.\n\nInitially, we started with 64 variables. To address the \"curse of dimensionality,\" we first filtered out variables that are not typically referenced in clinical practice for prescribing biologics. This step left us with 15 variables known to be of clinical importance, such as sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and five comorbidities.\n\nNext, we identified 20 additional variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD). This data-driven approach ensured that the selected variables had a strong association with the outcome of interest.\n\nBy combining these two sets of variables, we created a fixed set of 35 input parameters. This final set of variables was used to train our prediction models, ensuring that the models were based on a robust and clinically relevant dataset.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a total of 35 variables as input features for the prediction models. Initially, 64 variables were considered, but to avoid the \"curse of dimensionality,\" feature selection was performed. This process involved selecting variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for the prescription of biologics and excluding those not referenced in such prescriptions. Consequently, 15 clinically important variables were preselected. Additionally, 20 variables highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) were selected. The final set of 35 variables was then used to create the prediction model. Feature selection was conducted using the training dataset only, ensuring that the test set remained independent for validation purposes.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed five machine learning models to predict remission in subjects receiving various biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). To address the potential issue of overfitting, given the large number of variables compared to the size of the data, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirst, the dataset was divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. The models were trained using the training set, and their prediction results were verified using the test set. This split helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset to tune the hyperparameters. This technique involves dividing the training data into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\nA grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters, with the objective function being the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. This systematic approach helps in finding the optimal hyperparameters that minimize overfitting.\n\nBootstrapping, which involves random sampling with replacement, was also performed to obtain a more reliable estimate of the AUROC curve. This technique helps in reducing measurement variances caused by small sample sizes when dividing the data into training and test sets.\n\nTo avoid the \"curse of dimensionality,\" dimension reduction was performed. Initially, 64 variables were considered, but this was reduced to 35 variables known to be of clinical importance. This reduction helps in focusing on the most relevant features, thereby improving the model's performance and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, the study employed a combination of data splitting, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and dimension reduction to address the potential issues of overfitting and underfitting. These methods ensure that the models are robust and generalize well to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To prevent overfitting, several techniques were employed. The dataset was split into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. The training set was used to train the models, while the test set was used to verify the prediction results. Additionally, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset to tune the hyperparameters. This involved conducting a grid search to evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters, with the objective function being the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve for each model. Bootstrapping, which involves random sampling with replacement, was also performed to obtain a more reliable estimate of the AUROC curve and to reduce measurement variances caused by small sample sizes when dividing the data into training and test sets.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule are reported in the supplementary materials. Specifically, the hyperparameters for biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and for the prediction of remission without increasing prednisolone dose are detailed in Table S1 and Table S2, respectively. These tables provide a comprehensive overview of the parameters used during the model training process.\n\nThe optimization process involved a grid search to evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters, with the objective function being the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. This method ensured that the optimal hyperparameters were selected for each model.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the data used in this study are available from the Clinical Research Committee of the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics and Targeted Therapy Registry (KOBIO) for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data.

This ensures that the findings and methods can be reproduced and built upon by other researchers in the field.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black-box model. Instead, it leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide clear insights into the prediction process. The XAI approach used here is based on the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. This method approximates complex models to linear models, making it easier to interpret feature importance. SHAP values help in understanding how each feature contributes to the prediction, showing both the magnitude and direction of the effect.\n\nFor instance, the SHAP method was used to identify important clinical features associated with remission in patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The SHAP plot visually represents the impact of various features on predicting remission, making it easier to understand the complex relationships between variables and outcomes. This transparency is crucial for clinicians, as it allows them to gain insights into achieving remission and to identify potential variables affecting the selection of appropriate bDMARDs.\n\nThe SHAP method satisfies several key conditions: it ensures that the approximated linear model has similar accuracy to the original model in the local domain, meaningless variables have no impact on the explanatory power of the model, and feature importance is consistent across the model structure. This consistency and interpretability make the model a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. It was designed to predict remission in subjects receiving various biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and non-TNF inhibitors. The models used included lasso, ridge, support vector machine, random forest, and Xgboost. These models were trained to classify patients into those who would achieve remission and those who would not, based on a set of clinical variables.\n\nThe performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. The AUROC curve is a common metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, as it provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes (remission and non-remission).\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the model, several techniques were employed, including 5-fold cross-validation, grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and bootstrapping to reduce measurement variances caused by small sample sizes. These techniques helped to optimize the model's performance and generalizability.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model aimed at predicting remission in patients receiving bDMARDs, with its performance evaluated using standard classification metrics.",

  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the performance of the machine learning models used to predict remission in subjects receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), several rigorous methods were employed. The dataset was split into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio to avoid overfitting. The training set underwent a 5-fold cross-validation process to tune the hyperparameters, ensuring that the models were optimized for accuracy.

The no information rate, which represents the largest proportion of the observed classes, was used as a baseline for comparison. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, with model training conducted using the caret package and SHAPforxgboost package. This comprehensive evaluation method ensured that the models were robust and reliable in predicting remission in patients receiving bDMARDs.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of five machine learning models used to predict remission in subjects receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The primary performance metrics reported were accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC).\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. It provides a general indication of how often the model's predictions are correct. The AUROC, on the other hand, evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. A higher AUROC indicates better model performance.\n\nThe accuracy and AUROC values for predicting remission ranged from 52.8% to 72.9% and 0.512 to 0.694, respectively, across different machine learning methods. These metrics were also reported for specific categories of bDMARDs, including all bDMARDs, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and non-TNF inhibitors. For instance, the accuracy and AUROC for TNF inhibitors ranged from 68.4% to 70.0% and 0.633 to 0.655, respectively, while for non-TNF inhibitors, these values ranged from 52.8% to 58.3% and 0.538 to 0.607, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of the machine learning models to a baseline, known as the no information rate, which represents the largest proportion of the observed classes. This baseline helps in understanding the overall distribution of the classification and provides a reference point for evaluating the models' performance.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of common practices in the literature for evaluating machine learning models in medical research. Accuracy and AUROC are widely used metrics that provide a comprehensive view of model performance, especially in binary classification tasks like predicting remission. These metrics allow for a clear comparison of our models' performance with other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the performance of various machine learning models in predicting remission in patients receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). We employed five different machine learning models: lasso, ridge, support vector machine, random forest, and Xgboost. These models were chosen to predict remission in subjects receiving bDMARDs, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, non-TNF inhibitors, and each specific bDMARD.\n\nTo ensure robustness and avoid overfitting, we divided the dataset into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. The models were trained on the training set, and their prediction results were verified using the test set. Additionally, we performed 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset to tune the hyperparameters, using a grid search to evaluate all possible combinations. The objective function for determining the optimal hyperparameters was the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve.\n\nFor baseline comparison, we used the no information rate, which is the largest proportion of the observed classes. This baseline helped us determine the overall distribution of the classification and compare it with the performance of our machine learning models. This approach allowed us to assess the effectiveness of our models in predicting remission beyond simple baseline predictions.\n\nWe also performed bootstrapping to obtain a more reliable estimate of the AUROC curve and to reduce measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets. This statistical technique involved random sampling with replacement to validate the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our methods directly with publicly available benchmarks, we employed rigorous statistical techniques and baseline comparisons to evaluate the performance of our machine learning models in predicting remission in patients receiving bDMARDs.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed several techniques to ensure the confidence of the evaluation results. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was split into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Additionally, a 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset to tune the hyperparameters, using a grid search to evaluate all possible combinations. This process aimed to find optimal hyperparameters based on the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve for each model.\n\nBootstrapping was also utilized to obtain a more reliable estimate of the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy. This method helps reduce measurement variances caused by small sample sizes when dividing the data into training and test sets.\n\nThe performance metrics, including accuracy and AUROC, were reported for various machine learning models across different categories of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The ranges of these metrics were provided, indicating the variability and reliability of the results. For instance, the accuracy and AUROC for predicting remission using all bDMARDs ranged from 59.8% to 62.0% and 0.596 to 0.619, respectively. These ranges give an idea of the consistency and confidence in the model's performance.\n\nStatistical significance was not explicitly mentioned in the context of comparing the models to baselines or to each other. However, the use of cross-validation and bootstrapping suggests a rigorous approach to evaluating the models' performance, which indirectly supports the confidence in the results. The no information rate, which represents the largest proportion of the observed classes, was used as a baseline for comparison.
