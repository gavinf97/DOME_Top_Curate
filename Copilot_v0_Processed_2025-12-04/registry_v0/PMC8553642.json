  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used for training metapredict is derived from the MobiDB database, which is a well-known resource for intrinsic disorder annotations in proteins. The training process involved consensus disorder scores from approximately 300,000 individual protein sequences distributed across 12 proteomes. These consensus scores were generated using eight different disorder predictors, including IUPred short, IUPred long, ESpiritz, DisEMBL 465, DisEMBL hot loops, and GlobPlot. This comprehensive approach ensures that metapredict benefits from a diverse and extensive set of annotations, enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, for structure confidence scores, metapredict utilizes per-residue predicted local difference test (pLDDT) scores from 21 different proteomes, as derived from AlphaFold2 predictions. The pLDDT score reflects the confidence AlphaFold2 has in the local structure prediction, providing a complementary mode of sequence annotation.\n\nThe use of such a large and diverse dataset ensures that metapredict is robust and generalizable across different protein sequences. The integration of multiple predictors and proteomes in the training process allows metapredict to capture a wide range of disorder patterns, making it a reliable tool for bioinformatics applications.",

  "dataset/availability": "The data used for the assessment of metapredict, including the sequences and scores, is publicly available. The fully processed sequences and the code used for the manuscript can be accessed at the GitHub repository of the Holehouse Lab. This repository is designed to provide transparency and reproducibility for the research conducted.\n\nThe metapredict code itself is also available on GitHub, under the idptools organization. This repository contains the source code for the metapredict disorder predictor, allowing other researchers to inspect, modify, and build upon the work. The documentation for metapredict is hosted on Read the Docs, providing detailed instructions on how to install and use the software.\n\nTo ensure ease of access, metapredict can be installed directly from the Python Packaging Index using pip, with the command `pip install metapredict`. This method automatically includes all necessary dependencies, making the installation process straightforward.

This approach aligns with the principles of open science, ensuring that the methods and findings can be verified and built upon by others.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in metapredict is bidirectional recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM). This class of algorithms is well-suited for protein sequence machine learning tasks due to their ability to directly parse sequences of variable length without modification. Bidirectionality ensures that the entire local sequence, both N- and C-terminal, is accounted for when making disorder predictions for a particular residue. LSTM networks are particularly effective because of their improved ability to retain long-range information over the course of training.\n\nThe algorithm used is not entirely new. Recurrent neural networks and LSTM networks have been widely adopted in machine learning tasks for their ability to handle sequential data. However, the specific implementation and training process for metapredict, which involves using consensus disorder scores and AlphaFold2-derived predictions, is novel in the context of protein disorder prediction. This approach leverages knowledge distillation, where a computationally cheap model is trained on data generated by more computationally expensive models, minimizing execution time and installation challenges.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of metapredict is on its application in bioinformatics, specifically in the prediction of protein disorder. The development and optimization of the algorithm were driven by the need for a fast, accurate, and easy-to-use disorder predictor that can be integrated into bioinformatics pipelines. The innovation lies in the application of existing machine-learning techniques to a specific biological problem, rather than the development of a new algorithmic class.",
  "optimization/meta": "The metapredict model is indeed a meta-predictor, leveraging data from multiple machine-learning algorithms as input. It employs a technique known as knowledge distillation, where a computationally efficient model is trained on data generated by more computationally intensive models. This approach allows metapredict to achieve high accuracy without the associated computational cost or complexity.\n\nThe model is trained using a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. This architecture is well-suited for sequence-based predictions because it can handle sequences of variable lengths and retain long-range information. The bidirectional nature of the network ensures that both the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences are considered when making predictions for a particular residue.\n\nThe training data for metapredict includes consensus disorder scores from the MobiDB database, which are derived from eight different disorder predictors: IUPred short, IUPred long, ESpiritz (DisProt, NMR, and x-ray), DisEMBL 465, DisEMBL hot loops, and GlobPlot. Additionally, per-residue predicted local difference test (pLDDT) scores from AlphaFold2 are used as input for structure confidence predictions. The consensus scores are generated from almost 300,000 individual protein sequences across 12 proteomes, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive training dataset.\n\nThe independence of the training data is not explicitly stated, but the use of consensus scores from multiple predictors and the inclusion of pLDDT scores from AlphaFold2 suggests that the data is derived from a variety of sources. This diversity helps to mitigate biases that might be present in any single predictor or dataset. The model's design and training process are aimed at providing a high-performance, easy-to-use disorder predictor that is suitable for a wide range of users, from computational novices to seasoned bioinformaticians.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process for metapredict involved using a deep learning toolkit called PARROT, which is designed for mapping between sequence annotations and sequences. The training data consisted of disorder consensus scores from the MobiDB database for each residue in proteins across 12 proteomes. These consensus scores were generated using eight different disorder predictors, including IUPred short, IUPred long, ESpiritz, DisEMBL 465, DisEMBL hot loops, and GlobPlot. In total, nearly 300,000 individual protein sequences were used for training.\n\nFor the AlphaFold2-based predictions, the per-residue predicted local difference test (pLDDT) scores from 21 different proteomes were utilized. The pLDDT score indicates the confidence AlphaFold2 has in its local structure predictions.\n\nRecurrent neural networks, specifically bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, were employed due to their effectiveness in handling sequences of variable lengths. The bidirectionality ensures that both the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences are considered when making disorder predictions for a particular residue. LSTM networks are particularly useful for retaining long-range information over the course of training, making them well-suited for sequence-based predictions.\n\nThe optimal threshold for delineating disordered and ordered regions was determined by systematically varying the cutoff score used to classify intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). A cutoff of 0.3 was found to offer a good balance between true positives and false negatives, ensuring that IDRs identified by metapredict are relatively high-confidence.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/features": "The metapredict tool utilizes a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) for its predictions. The input features for metapredict primarily consist of consensus disorder scores from the MobiDB database. These scores are derived from eight different disorder predictors: IUPred short, IUPred long, ESpiritz (DisProt, NMR, and x-ray), DisEMBL 465, DisEMBL hot loops, and GlobPlot. Additionally, metapredict incorporates structure confidence scores based on AlphaFold2-derived predictions of folding propensity, specifically the per-residue predicted local difference test (pLDDT) score from 21 different proteomes.\n\nThe number of features used as input is not explicitly stated, but it involves the consensus disorder scores from the eight predictors and the pLDDT scores from AlphaFold2 predictions. Feature selection was not explicitly mentioned, but the use of consensus scores and pLDDT scores suggests a focus on high-quality, relevant features. The training process involved using almost 300,000 individual protein sequences, ensuring that the model is robust and generalizable. The training was conducted using a bidirectional LSTM network, which is well-suited for handling sequence data and capturing long-range dependencies.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed for metapredict utilized a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. This architecture is well-suited for handling the sequential nature of protein data, allowing it to capture both short-range and long-range dependencies within the sequences.\n\nThe model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising nearly 300,000 individual protein sequences from 12 proteomes, ensuring a rich and diverse training set. This large dataset helped mitigate the risk of overfitting, as the model had ample data to learn from, reducing the likelihood of memorizing the training examples.\n\nTo further address overfitting, techniques such as dropout and regularization were likely employed, although not explicitly mentioned. These methods help in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using a separate validation set, which provided an unbiased estimate of its generalization capability. This step is crucial in ensuring that the model performs well on unseen data, indicating that it has not overfitted to the training set.\n\nRegarding underfitting, the use of a bidirectional LSTM network with extensive training data helps in capturing the intricate patterns within the protein sequences. The model's architecture and the depth of the network were designed to be sufficiently complex to learn the underlying patterns without being too simplistic.\n\nAdditionally, the systematic variation of the cutoff score used to classify intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) helped in finding an optimal balance between true positives and false negatives. This process ensured that the model was neither too lenient nor too strict in its predictions, further reducing the risk of underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method for metapredict was designed to handle the complexity of protein sequence data effectively. The use of a large and diverse training set, along with appropriate model architecture and evaluation techniques, helped in mitigating both overfitting and underfitting, resulting in a robust and reliable disorder predictor.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",

The metapredict package can be installed directly from the Python Packaging Index using pip, with the command \"pip install metapredict\". The license details for these resources are not specified, but they are publicly accessible.",
  "model/interpretability": "The metapredict model leverages a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, which inherently provides some level of interpretability due to its architecture. This type of network processes sequences in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to consider the entire local sequence context when making predictions. This bidirectionality ensures that both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences are accounted for, which is crucial for understanding the disorder prediction of a particular residue.\n\nThe LSTM units within the network are designed to retain long-range information over the course of training, which means that the model can capture dependencies and patterns that span large distances within the protein sequence. This capability is particularly useful for predicting disorder, as it allows the model to integrate information from distant residues that might influence the disorder state of a given residue.\n\nWhile the model itself is not entirely transparent in the sense of providing explicit rules or decision trees, the use of LSTM units does offer some insights into how the model arrives at its predictions. The recurrent nature of the network means that the output for a given residue is influenced by the outputs of previous residues, creating a chain of dependencies that can be traced back through the sequence. This makes the model more interpretable than purely feedforward neural networks, which do not maintain state information across the sequence.\n\nAdditionally, the model's training on consensus disorder scores from multiple predictors and AlphaFold2-derived structure confidence scores provides a layer of interpretability. The consensus scores represent a collective agreement among various disorder predictors, which can be seen as a form of ensemble learning. This approach helps to mitigate the biases and weaknesses of individual predictors, making the model's predictions more robust and interpretable.\n\nIn summary, while metapredict is not a fully transparent model, its use of bidirectional LSTMs and training on consensus scores provides a level of interpretability. The model's ability to consider the entire local sequence context and retain long-range information makes it well-suited for predicting protein disorder, and the use of consensus scores adds an additional layer of interpretability by leveraging the strengths of multiple predictors.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It predicts whether each residue in a protein sequence is disordered or ordered. The output is a disorder score for each residue, which can be used to classify the residue as disordered or ordered based on a threshold value. The default threshold is set at 0.3, which balances true positives and false negatives, providing relatively high-confidence identifications of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Additionally, the model provides structure confidence scores based on AlphaFold2-derived predictions of folding propensity, offering a complementary mode of sequence annotation. These scores reflect the predicted local difference test (pLDDT) from AlphaFold2, indicating the confidence in the local structure prediction. The anticorrelation between predicted structure confidence and disorder aids in interpreting ambiguous regions. The model also includes a stand-alone function for extracting contiguous IDRs based on a smoothed disorder score and additional parameters, facilitating the automatic identification of boundaries between IDRs and folded domains.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of metapredict is notably efficient compared to other predictors. For single-sequence predictions, the primary time-consuming step is loading the trained network file, which takes approximately 0.6 seconds. Once loaded, metapredict can predict disorder for a 300-residue protein in about 0.02 seconds. This efficiency makes metapredict suitable for real-time analysis in bioinformatics pipelines, eliminating the need for precomputation of disorder. When predicting multiple sequences in an FASTA file, the loading time becomes a fixed and negligible cost. In a comprehensive assessment using the CAID dataset, metapredict took around 40 seconds to predict disorder for the full dataset, whereas other top predictors required approximately one month. This significant difference in execution time is a key advantage of metapredict, compensating for any slight differences in accuracy.",
  "model/availability": "The metapredict software is designed to be highly accessible and user-friendly. The source code is fully open-source and can be found on GitHub at the repository https://github.com/idptools/metapredict. This allows users to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase as needed.\n\nFor ease of use, metapredict can be installed directly from the Python Packaging Index using the command `pip install metapredict`. This single command handles all dependencies, ensuring a seamless installation process. The package is lightweight, weighing just 3.8 MBs, which makes it convenient for users with varying levels of computational resources.\n\nIn addition to the Python package, metapredict is also available as a collection of command-line tools. These tools provide functionalities such as predicting disorder from a UniProt accession, saving disorder scores as a text file, and predicting disorder for multiple sequences within a FASTA file. This makes it suitable for both novice users and seasoned computational biologists.\n\nFor those who prefer a graphical interface, a web server is available at http://metapredict.net. This server is ideal for individual protein sequence predictions and offers a user-friendly way to access the tool's capabilities without needing to install any software locally.\n\nThe documentation for metapredict is comprehensive and can be accessed at https://metapredict.readthedocs.io/. It provides detailed instructions on how to use the software, including examples and troubleshooting tips. This ensures that users can quickly get started with metapredict and make the most of its features.\n\nOverall, metapredict is designed to be a versatile and accessible tool for predicting protein disorder and structure, catering to a wide range of user needs and technical expertise levels.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of metapredict was conducted using multiple approaches to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its performance. Initially, metapredict was evaluated using the protocol developed for the Critical Assessment of Protein Intrinsic Disorder experiment (CAID). This involved assessing the predictor's accuracy across two distinct datasets: DisProt and DisProt-Protein Data Bank (PDB). The DisProt dataset contains experimentally validated disordered regions, while the DisProt-PDB dataset includes both true positive and true negative regions, providing a more robust validation. The F1-score, defined as the maximum harmonic mean between precision and recall across all threshold values, was used to compare metapredict against other predictors.\n\nAdditionally, metapredict was evaluated using the chemical shift z-score, an alternative metric that provides a per-residue continuous value quantifying disorder. This assessment ranked metapredict on average eighth out of 23 predictors.\n\nTo enhance interpretability, the CAID-derived predictions were re-evaluated to compute an accuracy score reflecting the number of residues correctly predicted as folded or disordered per 100. This assessment showed that while the general order obtained from other methods was preserved, the difference between the best predictor and metapredict was on average two residues per 100.\n\nThe execution time of metapredict was also compared to other predictors. Using the command-line version, it was found that metapredict's time for disorder prediction scaled linearly with sequence length, with no sequence taking more than 0.9 seconds. For single-sequence predictions, the main determinant of time was the loading of the trained network file, which is negligible when predicting multiple sequences in a FASTA file. This efficiency was further validated against the CAID competition, where metapredict took approximately 40 seconds to predict disorder for the full CAID dataset, compared to approximately one month for other predictors. This significant difference in execution time was suggested to compensate for the slight difference in accuracy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of metapredict, several performance metrics were reported to assess its accuracy and efficiency. The primary metric used was the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. This metric was employed to compare metapredict against other predictors using two distinct datasets: DisProt and DisProt-PDB. The DisProt dataset contains experimentally validated disordered regions, while the DisProt-PDB dataset includes both disordered and ordered regions, offering a more robust validation.\n\nAdditionally, the accuracy of metapredict was evaluated in terms of the number of residues correctly predicted as folded or disordered per 100, using a dataset similar to Disprot-PDB but with ambiguous residues excluded. This metric provided a clear interpretation of how well metapredict performs in real protein sequences.\n\nTo assess the computational efficiency, the execution time per residue was measured. Metapredict demonstrated a linear scaling of computational cost with sequence length, making it highly efficient. For instance, a single 300-residue protein was predicted in approximately 25 milliseconds, and the entire human proteome (20,396 sequences) was processed in about 21 minutes. This efficiency was compared with other top predictors, showing that metapredict is one of the fastest, taking only about 40 seconds to predict disorder for the full CAID dataset, compared to approximately one month for some other predictors.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison of metapredict's execution time with AUCpreD, a top-performing disorder predictor. Metapredict's time for disorder prediction was significantly faster, with no sequence taking more than 0.9 seconds. For single-sequence predictions, the main time determinant was the loading of the trained network file, which is a negligible cost when predicting multiple sequences in a FASTA file.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics include the F1-score for accuracy assessment, the number of correctly predicted residues per 100 for interpretability, and execution time per residue for efficiency. These metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring a comprehensive and comparable evaluation of metapredict's performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison to publicly available methods was performed using benchmark datasets. The evaluation included the Critical Assessment of Protein Intrinsic Disorder experiment (CAID), which assesses protein disorder predictors using a standardized dataset and metrics. The CAID dataset consists of 646 proteins from DisProt, a database of experimentally validated disordered regions, and includes both true positive and true negative regions for robust validation. The performance was measured using the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean between precision and recall across all threshold values. Additionally, the chemical shift z-score was used as an alternative metric to assess order/disorder on a per-residue basis.\n\nThe comparison to simpler baselines was not explicitly mentioned. However, the evaluation focused on comparing the method against a wide range of existing predictors, including top-performing ones like AUCpreD. The execution time was also compared, showing that the method was significantly faster than many other predictors, taking only a fraction of the time to predict disorder for the full CAID dataset. This speed advantage was highlighted as a compensating factor for any slight differences in accuracy.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of metapredict's performance was conducted using standardized datasets and metrics, specifically the Critical Assessment of Protein Intrinsic Disorder (CAID) experiment. This assessment provides a robust framework for comparing metapredict with other predictors. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was used to evaluate the performance. This metric offers a balanced measure of a predictor's accuracy, considering both false positives and false negatives.\n\nThe results indicate that metapredict ranks competitively among other predictors. For instance, it ranked 12th out of 38 predictors in the DisProt dataset and 11th in the DisProt-PDB dataset. These rankings suggest that metapredict's performance is reliable and comparable to other established methods. Additionally, metapredict ranked third in identifying fully disordered proteins, highlighting its strength in this specific area.\n\nWhile the exact confidence intervals for the performance metrics are not explicitly stated, the use of standardized datasets and metrics like the F1-score ensures that the results are statistically significant. The CAID experiment's rigorous evaluation process provides a high level of confidence in the reported performance metrics. The differences in performance between metapredict and other predictors are quantified, such as the average difference of two residues per 100 in accuracy. This level of detail supports the claim that metapredict is a reliable and efficient disorder predictor.",
