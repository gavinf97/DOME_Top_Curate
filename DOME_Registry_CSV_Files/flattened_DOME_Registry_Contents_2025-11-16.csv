Missing residues, including those with occupancy equal to zero, were treated as disordered.

For binding prediction in the disordered regions, A set of 840 peptides, with lengths between 5 and 25 amino acids and solved in complex with globular protein domains, was initially obtained from a previous study (Disfani et al., 2012). They discarded 196 peptides that couldn’t be mapped onto UniProtKB (UniProt,2014) sequences with SIFTS (Velankar et al., 2013)—because they were synthetic constructs, or the PDB files had been superseded, or the ATOM records mapped onto discontinuous fragments. They also removed 247 chains sharing 30% or more sequence identity to other regions, based on the BLASTP alignments generated with the recommended settings for short peptides (-seg no -matrix PAM30 -gapopen 10 -gapextend 1 -word_size 3).

Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-Snot reportedP software.

Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when
present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest
lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours. 

Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.

Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.

Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.

Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed.

Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL.
The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).

The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them. 

Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal Rnot reported to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices.

Accuracy
Global Distance Test - Total Score
Root Mean Square Deviation 
TM-score 
Global Local Distance Difference Test 
Contact Score

Machine learning specific model performance measures:
AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): Used for assessing contact and distance predictions (evaluating classification of residue-residue contacts).
AUC-PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve): Used alongside AUC-ROC for imbalanced data in contact prediction.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures correlation between predicted and actual residue-residue distances.
Spearman Rank Correlation: Evaluates ranking consistency between predicted and actual distances.
PPV (Positive Predictive Value): Measures precision in predicting contacts.
Precision & Recall: Assesses accuracy of long-range contact predictions.

Boruta feature selection (Kursa and Rudnicki (2010) J. Statist. Softw. Artic. 36, 1–13) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method (Peng et al (2005) IEEE Transact. Patt. Anal. Mach. Intel. 27, 1226–1238) were used, to evaluate the importance of each feature. Key features were then selected, and fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) with supervised classifiers to identify the optimal gene signatures for screening different TCs.   The IFS was run with SVM, RIPPER, and RF, respectively.   The optimal numbers of features turned out to be 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).

CAN used the convolutional attention network to obtain the discrete distribution patterns of SDRs in protein sequences. HAN employed the hierarchical attention model to capture the sequence location of LDRs mainly located in the N’ and C’ of the sequences. IDP-Seq2Seq combined Seq2Seq and attention mechanism to capture the global and non-local correlation features of residues in IDRs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to extract local features of IDRs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to extract global features of IDRs. The CNN and LSTM were combined to obtain both the local features and global features of IDRs. Two models CNN-LSTM and LSTM-CNN were constructed inspired by SPOT-Disorder2. They employed the neural architecture search (NAS) model DARTS to capture the hidden features of protein sequences",,0.71,They constructed 5 validation sets with different ratios of SDR and LDR proteins. ,"In this study, five commonly used datasets with different ratios between SDRs and LDRs were used to evaluate the performance of different methods., including MXD494, SL329, DISORDER723, CASP, and Disprot504(https://disprot.org/).

,"For the calculation of the F1 score, the center distance between the predicted nuclei and the ground truth nuclei was used. For each ground truth nucleus, predictions within a 15 pixel (3.3 μm) were identified. This radius is smaller than the average size of lymphocytes, which form the smallest nuclei in the dataset. Matching was performed based on the highest predictive score (if available) or the shortest distance. After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40]. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is calculated through bootstrapping the samples. 

Both models and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated using the DICE score. The DICE score is a harmonic mean between 0 and 1, in which 1 is a perfect segmentation prediction, and 0 is no correct prediction. This can result in inflated high average DICE scores if a tissue class is only present in a few samples, as the DICE score is 1 in the case of a correct absent prediction. To accommodate this, we calculated not only the average DICE score over all samples but also the micro average DICE. This is the DICE score for all predictions concatenated along one axis, resulting in a prediction mask of 1024 × 96.256 pixels.

Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set.

Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan.

Using various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5).

Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding λmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed λmax values using phylogenetic imputation.

One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V.

output. For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree. For AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, extra tree, and

Given that benchmark methods EMOGI and MTGCN both use 64 features and the performance difference between 50 and 64 features is minimal, we chose 50 from a model performance analysis perspective to provide a clear rationale for our selection.","The machine learning approach used in this study falls within the class of graph neural networks (GNNs). While graph neural networks themselves are not new, they possess previously unexplored advantages for node classification tasks, especially when integrating multi-omics data and protein-protein interaction networks. This makes GNNs particularly well-suited for essential gene prediction, as they effectively capture both network topology and complex biological features that other methods struggle to model.",,1,"We employed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate model performance. 80% of the data were allocated for training and 20% for testing. Within the training subset, 90% was used for final training and 10% for validation, which was utilized for model tuning and early stopping. Although the original label data consist of 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg), the actual number of genes involved in training varies depending on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as not all genes are present in every network. For instance, in the STRING network, only a subset of genes is retained after filtering based on network inclusion.

Given that non-essential genes outnumber essential genes by more than fourfold, and that the number of available genes varies across networks, direct training would suffer from a class imbalance problem, potentially resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority (essential) class. To mitigate this, we adopted a resampling strategy whereby, for each training, validation, and test split, all essential genes were included alongside randomly selected non-essential genes at a 1:4 ratio. Using the STRING network as an example, this procedure yielded 6,048 genes in the training set, 972 in the validation set, and 1,680 in the test set. Because the splits were dynamically generated in each fold, we did not plot the distributions explicitly, but the stratification process guarantees that the class balance is consistent across training, validation, and test sets.","The dataset was split using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure independence between training and test sets in each fold. Specifically, genes were partitioned so that no gene appeared in both training and test sets within the same fold, thus maintaining non-overlapping sets. Similar to our approach, other gene classification methods such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study) also employ cross-validation strategies to split data into training and test sets. Cross-validation provides a robust framework for performance evaluation by ensuring that each sample is tested while maintaining independence between training and testing data within each fold. This approach is widely used in the community for gene-level prediction tasks, especially when datasets are limited in size or exhibit class imbalance. Therefore, our use of stratified cross-validation aligns with established practices in similar studies.",,0,"In our study, the number of trainable parameters p is moderately higher than the number of training samples. For example, under the STRING network setting, the training set contains around 6,000 genes. We only use 50 node features so our model does not fall into the regime where f > 100. To prevent overfitting, we applied several strategies, including stratified cross-validation, early stopping based on validation performance, dropout, and L2 regularization. These techniques help the model generalize effectively. Conversely, to avoid underfitting, we tuned the model’s complexity (e.g., number of layers and hidden channels). The consistent results across validation folds suggest that the model's capacity is appropriate for the task.",41134033,Subgraph,GigaScience,05q1xlke1j,688fc2386163a9cb4ff9f33f,"Haimei Wen, Susan Carpenter, Karen McGinnis, Andrew Nelson, Keriayn Smith, Tian Hong",The method was evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust assessment of model performance. ,CRISPR,Biological Networks,Essential Genes,"Haimei Wen, Susan Carpenter, Karen McGinnis, Andrew Nelson, Keriayn Smith, Tian Hong","We used 5-fold cross-validation and conducted 10 rounds, obtaining 50 sets of data.
