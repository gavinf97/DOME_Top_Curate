The firing patterns of neurons in the basal ganglia are known to become more oscillatory and synchronized from healthy to parkinsonian conditions. Similar changes have been observed with local field potentials (LFPs). In this study, we used an unbiased machine learning approach to investigate the utility of pallidal LFPs for discriminating the stages of a progressive parkinsonian model. A feature selection algorithm was used to identify subsets of LFP features that provided the most discriminatory information for severity of parkinsonian motor signs. Prediction errors <20% were achievable using 28 of the possible 206 features tested. For all subjects, a spectral feature within the beta band was chosen through the feature selection algorithm, but a combination of features, including alpha-band power and phase-amplitude coupling, was necessary to achieve minimal prediction errors. There was large variability between the discriminatory features for individual subjects, and testing of classifiers between subjects yielded prediction errors >50%. These results suggest that pallidal oscillations can be predictive biomarkers of parkinsonian severity, but the features are more complex than spectral power in individual frequency bands, such as the beta band. Additionally, the best feature set was subject specific, which highlights the pathophysiological heterogeneity of parkinsonism and the importance of subject specificity when designing closed-loop system controllers dependent on such features.

Although many methods have been published to date, only few of them are suitable for use in automated pipelines or for processing large datasets.

It is based on prediction of ligandability of local chemical neighbourhoods that are centered on points placed on the solvent accessible surface of a protein. We show that P2Rank outperforms several existing tools, which include two widely used stand-alone tools (Fpocket, SiteHound), a comprehensive consensus based tool (MetaPocket 2.0), and a recent deep learning based method (DeepSite). P2Rank belongs to the fastest available tools (requires under 1 s for prediction on one protein), with additional advantage of multi-threaded implementation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>P2Rank is a new open source software package for ligand binding site prediction from protein structure. It is available as a user-friendly stand-alone command line program and a Java library. P2Rank has a lightweight installation and does not depend on other bioinformatics tools or large structural or sequence databases. Thanks to its speed and ability to make fully automated predictions, it is particularly well suited for processing large datasets or as a component of scalable structural bioinformatics pipelines.

P2Rank belongs to the fastest available tools (requires under 1 s for prediction on one protein), with additional advantage of multi-threaded implementation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>P2Rank is a new open source software package for ligand binding site prediction from protein structure. It is available as a user-friendly stand-alone command line program and a Java library. P2Rank has a lightweight installation and does not depend on other bioinformatics tools or large structural or sequence databases. Thanks to its speed and ability to make fully automated predictions, it is particularly well suited for processing large datasets or as a component of scalable structural bioinformatics pipelines.

With comparatively few validated plant long non-coding RNAs, research on this potentially critical class of RNA is hindered by a lack of appropriate prediction tools and databases. Supervised learning models trained on data sets of mostly non-validated, non-coding transcripts have been previously used to identify this enigmatic RNA class with applications largely focused on animal systems. Our approach uses a training set comprised only of empirically validated long non-protein coding RNAs from plant, animal, and viral sources to predict and rank candidate long non-protein coding gene products for future functional validation.<h4>Results</h4>Individual stochastic gradient boosting and random forest classifiers trained on only empirically validated long non-protein coding RNAs were constructed.

Most of the highest ranking predictions from Arabidopsis thaliana were annotated as potential natural antisense genes, pseudogenes, transposable elements, or simply computationally predicted hypothetical protein. Due to the nature of this tool, the model can be updated as new long non-protein coding transcripts are identified and functionally verified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This ensemble classifier is an accurate tool that can be used to rank long non-protein coding RNA predictions for use in conjunction with gene expression studies.

Intrinsically disordered or unstructured proteins (or regions in proteins) have been found to be important in a wide range of biological functions and implicated in many diseases. Due to the high cost and low efficiency of experimental determination of intrinsic disorder and the exponential increase of unannotated protein sequences, developing complementary computational prediction methods has been an active area of research for several decades. Here, we employed an ensemble of deep Squeeze-and-Excitation residual inception and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for predicting protein intrinsic disorder with input from evolutionary information and predicted one-dimensional structural properties. The method, called SPOT-Disorder2, offers substantial and consistent improvement not only over our previous technique based on LSTM networks alone, but also over other state-of-the-art techniques in three independent tests with different ratios of disordered to ordered amino acid residues, and for sequences with either rich or limited evolutionary information.

Radiomics/statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB and CERR software. After ROC and correlation analysis, selected radiomics parameters were advanced to machine learning modelling alongside clinical MRI-based parameters (lesion type, multifocality, size, nodal status). For predicting pCR, the data was split into a training and test set (80:20).<h4>Findings</h4>The overall pCR rate was 60.5% (188/311). The final model to predict HER2 heterogeneity utilised three MRI parameters (two clinical, one radiomic) for a sensitivity of 99.3% (277/279), specificity of 81.3% (26/32), and diagnostic accuracy of 97.4% (303/311).

For predicting pCR, the data was split into a training and test set (80:20).<h4>Findings</h4>The overall pCR rate was 60.5% (188/311). The final model to predict HER2 heterogeneity utilised three MRI parameters (two clinical, one radiomic) for a sensitivity of 99.3% (277/279), specificity of 81.3% (26/32), and diagnostic accuracy of 97.4% (303/311). The final model to predict pCR included six MRI parameters (two clinical, four radiomic) for a sensitivity of 86.5% (32/37), specificity of 80.0% (20/25), and diagnostic accuracy of 83.9% (52/62) (test set); these results were independent of age and ER status, and outperformed the best model developed using clinical parameters only (p=0.029, comparison of proportion Chi-squared test).<h4>Interpretation</h4>The machine learning models, including both clinical and radiomics MRI features, can be used to assess HER2 expression level and can predict pCR after NAC in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.<h4>Funding</h4>NIH/NCI (P30CA008748), Susan G.

The purpose of this study was to identify the optimal biomarkers for ESCC using machine learning algorithms.<h4>Methods</h4>Biomarkers related to clinical survival, recurrence or therapeutic response of patients with ESCC were determined through literature database searching. Forty-eight biomarkers linked to recurrence or prognosis of ESCC were used to construct a molecular interaction network based on NetBox and then to identify the functional modules. Publicably available mRNA transcriptome data of ESCC downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets included GSE53625 and TCGA-ESCC. Five machine learning algorithms, including logical regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and XGBoost, were used to develop classifiers for prognostic classification for feature selection. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the prognostic classifiers. The importances of identified molecules were ranked by their occurrence frequencies in the prognostic classifiers. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were performed to determine the statistical significance of overall survival.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 48 clinically proven molecules associated with ESCC progression were used to construct a molecular interaction network with 3 functional modules comprising 17 component molecules. The 131,071 prognostic classifiers using these 17 molecules were built for each machine learning algorithm. Using the occurrence frequencies in the prognostic classifiers with AUCs greater than the mean value of all 131,071 AUCs to rank importances of these 17 molecules, stratifin encoded by SFN was identified as the optimal prognostic biomarker for ESCC, whose performance was further validated in another 2 independent cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The occurrence frequencies across various feature selection approaches reflect the degree of clinical importance and stratifin is an optimal prognostic biomarker for ESCC.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology studies transcriptome and cell-to-cell differences from higher single-cell resolution and different perspectives. Despite the advantage of high capture efficiency, downstream functional analysis of scRNA-seq data is made difficult by the excess of zero values (i.e., the dropout phenomenon). To effectively address this problem, we introduced scNTImpute, an imputation framework based on a neural topic model. A neural network encoder is used to extract underlying topic features of single-cell transcriptome data to infer high-quality cell similarity. At the same time, we determine which transcriptome data are affected by the dropout phenomenon according to the learning of the mixture model by the neural network. On the basis of stable cell similarity, the same gene information in other similar cells is borrowed to impute only the missing expression values. By evaluating the performance of real data, scNTImpute can accurately and efficiently identify the dropout values and imputes them accurately. In the meantime, the clustering of cell subsets is improved and the original biological information in cell clustering is solved, which is covered by technical noise.
