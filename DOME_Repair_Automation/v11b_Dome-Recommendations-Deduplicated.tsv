The maximum allowed mass and retention time tolerances were 10 ppm and 10 s, respectively. A local minimum search algorithm with a minimum relative peak height of 1% was used for chromatographic deconvolution; the maximum peak width was set to 1 min.

	Yes. Supplementary Data.	ChIP-seq data, including uniformly processed peak calling results and peak width of promoter histone modifications from Roadmap and ENCODE projects for active (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H2A.Z) and repressive (H3K27me3) promoter modifications, and marks associated with enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, DNase I hypersensitivity sites).   Curated haploinsufficient (HIS) genes, positive (Npos) training observations, were collected from haploinsufficient training genes used in previous studies and genes with haploinsufficient score of 3 in ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map.  Curated haplosufficient (HS) genes, negative (Nneg) training observations, included genes deleted in two or more healthy people, based on CNVs detected in 2026 normal individuals.  All data were used in previous studies. 	Starting_TSV	Only genes with half or more of its length covered by any deletion were considered “deleted” (HS genes) in an individual.  The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed:   1) Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation. 2) From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011). 3) From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed. 	Following pruning for the training set, Npos=287 curated haploinsufficient genes and Nneg=574 curated haplosufficient genes were considered for further analysis. 1) Ntrain=90%. Ntest=10%. 10-fold cross validation for training. 100 randomized runs. 2) Final training with all training data and estimation of probabilities. 			Yes. Supplementary Data.	Random Forest model performed better than SVM and SVM with Lasso, and it was chosen for training the final model (Episcore). Comparison of Episcore with pLI scores from ExAC, Shet values, and ranks of mouse heart expression level, using de novo likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) variants identified in: 1)  A previously published whole exome sequencing study DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders consortium) of 1365 trio families with congenital heart disease (CHD). 2) A second CHD WES cohort of 2645 parent−offspring trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). LGD variants include frameshift, nonsense and canonical splice site mutations. Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing LGD de novo variants than the other methods. 	Permutation testing.	ROC curve, AUC score, sensitivity, specificity	1) 100 randomized runs with Ntrain=90% and Ntest=10% for each run. 10-fold cross validation was applied. 2) For the best performing model (Random Forest) all training data were used to train the final model. 			Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	Not specified	Epigenomic features critical for the prediction were determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient between each epigenomic feature and Episcore (random forest model) prediction.   One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type.  To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by: 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.  This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features. 	Binary predictions. All training genes used to train the best performing Random Forest model, and then estimate the probabilities of being positive (HIS) for all genes. The whole process was repeated 30 times and the arithmetic mean of the 30 sets of probabilities was used as result.			Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and SVM with LASSO feature selection.	Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	For promoter features (H2A.Z, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac), GappedPeaks were used to allow for broad domains of ChIP-seq signal. The assignment of a GapppedPeak to a gene followed these steps in order:  1) For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used. 2) A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed. 3) For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept. 4) For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept. After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.  Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and RNA-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized. 	The widths of called ChIP-seq peaks was used as promoter features. The counts of the interacting number of promoters and enhancers within pre-defined topologically associated domains (TADs) as enhancer features. Specifically, the results of peak width and number of interacting enhancers were consolidated into a matrix, with each row being a gene and each column representing a combination of a tissue and a data type, e.g. “H3K4me3 peak width in fetal heart”. One combination of a tissue and a data type was referred to as one epigenomic feature. This matrix was used as input for the machine learning models.

	Yes. Supporting information.	Training dataset of 40 pairs of Pdu protein sequences whose presence or absence of physical, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) could be experimentally validated via binding assays, complementation and expression studies or crystallographic data.  Testing dataset of protein orthologs collected from 34 bacterial genomes in the KEGG database and collapsed among 22 orthologous protein groups, which represent types of bacterial microcompartment (MCP) proteins known to be associated with the propanediol utilizing (Pdu) system. 	Starting_TSV	Incomplete or erroneous annotations of the Pdu gene products were corrected after sequence comparison with the Pdu operon from Salmonella enterica LT2, the best-characterized strain in terms of Pdu MCP.	For the training set, Npos=16 interacting and Nneg=24 non-interacting protein pairs.

Results support the importance of all features for optimal model performance.	Binary predictions of pos for an interacting protein group pair and neg for those not interacting. For prediction probability is less than 0.7 then the result is neg, and for equal or greater than 0.7 the result is pos (increased specificity).			Random Forest classifier	Not available	For each ortholog group, its corresponding protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them.   Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal RNA to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices. 	For each protein pair, 7 coevolution features measuring the pairwise tree similarities have been defined.  Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL. The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).

To further reduce the effects of nuisance factors, signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were also regressed out.  DARTEL toolbox was used to normalize the data and the resulting images were finally smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.

Data is available from authors upon request.	1) To allow comparison between samples, all data were normalized to the internal standard in each chromatogram. The raw data consisting of 175 metabolites measured across 70 participants was normalized using min/max scaling.  2) Data imputation with IterativeImputer of sklearn was utilized to handle missing data. The trained imputer was tested by removing the data of one metabolite feature column and imputing the data afterward. The performance of the imputer was measured for each of the metabolites using R^2 metric. Metabolite columns with R^2 < 0.3 and more than 5% of missing values across all patients were removed. 3) Data standardization to zero mean and unit variance for each metabolite feature column.  Data pre-processing step reduced the feature columns to 75 metabolites.  	Metabolic profiles of 45 metabolites following data preprocessing. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV), using random forest, reduced the number of features to 15 metabolites.

	According to the author's statement, the data are not available because of patients’ privacy.	Clinical data from 4 different hospitals in China (4 different cities) about piatients with chronic B virus hepatitis. N = 1289 (patients from 4 different cities).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 815, N_neg (fibrosis) = 474 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 290, N_neg (cirrhosis) = 999.   Data not used by previous authors.	Starting_TSV	Not applicable.

Test set Anhui:   N = 408 (independent patients dataset from Anhui city).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 254 // N_neg (fibrosis) = 154 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 59 // N_neg (cirrhosis) = 359.     Test set Beijing:   N = 332 (independent patients dataset from Beijing city).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 179 // N_neg (fibrosis) = 153 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 74 // N_neg (cirrhosis) = 258.        69.6% positives (fibrosis), 28.6% positives (cirrhosis) on training set.   62.3% positives (fibrosis), 14.5% positives (cirrhosis) on Anhui test set.  53.9% positives (fibrosis), 22.3% positives (cirrhosis) on Beijing test set.  			No.	FibroBox was compared to 3 other pre-existing predicting methods: TE (Transient Elastography), APRI (Aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index), FIB-4 (fibrosis-4 index), the letter two being serum biomarkers. The LightGBM algorithm was coompared to Logistic regression and XGBoost. 	Confidence intervals at 95% for AUROC, statistical significance confirmed for the difference between FibroBox and each of TE, APRI, FIB-4 methods, both for fibrosis and for cyrrhosis predictions.	Precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy,  AUROC.  The latter was used for feature selection, and for comparison with other models. 	5-fold cross-validation during training-testing.  Two independent datasets were used as evaluation sets:  the Anhui cohort (n = 408), and the Beijing cohort (n=332).			The ML algorithms were implemented using Python 3.7.	The run time of FibroBox is mentioned in the Discussion to be only a few seconds.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   This LightGBM model looks to me complex enough to result rather black box.   Post-hoc analysis showed e.g. that the contribute of the Transient Elastography (TE) feature to the good predictability was very relevant, which is meaningful.  An explaination for an eventual joint effect of the 9 features was not adressed.	Classification.  Case A: positive and negative samples are non-significant fibrosis vs. significant fibrosis. Case B: positive and negative samples are non-cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis.			LightGBM (a gradient boosting framework using tree based learning algorithms) is stated in the Supplementary to have been the algorithm of choice.	No.	For character data field (like sex, pathogenesis), the LabelEncoder method in Python was used (categorical features encoded as a one-hot numeric array).	Starting from 24 features (clinical measurements commons to the 4 hospitals), 9 features were selected for training, by means of LASSO regression and filter methods (the latter being variance threshold, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, chi-square test and mutual information).	The LightGBM algorithm is stated in its documentation likely to be over-fitting if not used with the appropriate parameters. 	No.	The number of parameters was the standard for Python implementation of LightGBM.  Parameters were tuned to get good results by means of grid search, random search and the Python library Hyperopt.	"Yes.  The authors state that, ""to prevent overfitting, the index of colsample_bytree was set to 0.9"".    Other parameters tuning for over-fitting prevention is not mentioned.

No.	Logistic regression was compared to neural network (NN), neuro-fuzzy technology (NF), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).  None of those additional approaches significantly outperformed logistic regression. 	Inference for the ROC curves was based on cluster-robust standard errors that accounted for the serially correlated nature of the samples. It was not possible to create ROC curves and therefore AUC for RF and SVM since the outcome was not continuous. McNemar’s exact test was used to assess the significance of difference in SN at fixed SP and DeLong’s test was used to assess the significance of differences in AUC between approaches. Confidence intervals (CI 95%) for AUCs were derived based on the DeLong’s method to evaluate the uncertainty of an AUC; SN and SP 95% CI were derived using bootstrap replicates. To allow for multiple testing, both types of tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. 	AUROC (except for RF and SVM) and sensitivity at clinically relevant specificity.	Independent dataset.			Logistic regression: The “glmnet” package from R was used with elastic net regularisation.    NN: Python packages tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn.  RF: The “party” package from R.   SVM:  The “svmLinear” method from the “caret” package in R was used.  NF: The r-algorithm developed by Shor was used with a precision ε = 0.001. Software implementation of this approach was developed within the Visual Studio 2013 environment.	Not reported.	Logistic Regression is generally considered transparent.  In a previous work (PMID: 26240291) the authors examined the good predicting power of each of the 3 urine biomarkers (LYVE1, REG1A, and TFF1) taken separately.   However, an explaination of the joint effect of the variables has not been attempted.	Binary classification (high PDAC risk or not).			Logistic regression.	No.	Not reported.	Only 5 predictors available, no selection applied in this work.  The 5 predictors were the result of a selection applied in a previous work (PMID: 21136905), by quantifying differentially expressed proteins in urine proteomes.	Bootstrap cross-validation was used for the internal validation to ensure that overfitting is avoided. Following that, elastic net was used for the regularisation of the coefficients to obtain the final model.  	No.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.

No.	A transcriptional ‘risk metrics’ for ACPA-negative patients was bild, and the AUROC curve of the 12-gene signature was compared to the existing ‘Leiden prediction rule’ as a predictor of RA in the test set.   No difference in the performance was seen in this case.  However, by combining all features of the Leiden prediction rule with the 12-gene risk metric, and applying it to the ACPA-negative UA cohort (test set), the AUROC curve value improved from 0.74, SEM=0.08 (original Leiden prediction rule) to 0.84; SEM=0.06 (modified metric incorporating gene signature).

	Yes. Supporting Information.	Proteomes of urine samples from 54 T2D (Type 2 Diabetes) patients from Pusan National University Hospital, South Korea.

Starting_TSV	Not applicable	SVM model with linear kernel was generated by a 10 fold repeated three-fold cross validation.  The RF model was generated by a 3-fold cross validation method repeated 100 times.			No.	The performances of the SVM and RF models were compared to the predicting performance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a simple biomarker for DKD which has been widely used so far.	The authors state that the AUROC of the two classifiers (SVM and RF) differed significantly from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (likelihood ratio test: p-value < 0.05). However, for the RF AUROC (value = 1.0) no confidence intervals are reported, and the confidence intervals for SVM AUROC are not further specified.	AUROC.  Comparison of disease prediction scores.	Cross-validation.   Since the authors were unable to find a benchmarking study in the discovery of urine protein biomarkers, they evaluated the models with mRNA expression in the kidney.   The SVM and RF models consisting of 5 urine proteins were applied to 4 publicly available GEO datasets:  GSE99339, GSE47185, GSE30122, and GSE96804.  However, the predictions on such datasets were not statistically significant.			Data were analyzed using the publicly available RStudio (version 1.1.456) including R (version 3.6.0). 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   The RF and SVM are generally considered black box.   Post-hoc analysis resulted somewhat interpretable, since the 5 selected features correspond to 5 urinary proteins that are considered likely to be related to DKD.  However, their eventual joint effect remains not interpretable.	Binary classification (PPG or GPG).  The binary results of RF and SVM models were also transformed in disease prediction scores, which ranged from 0 to 1.			SVM and RF.	No.	Not reported.	The study focused on 412 proteins (of the 1296 identified proteins in each proteome) quantified in more than 80% of urine samples, with missing values filled by local least squares imputation.  From those 412 proteins, 5 proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method.

No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   The model looks to me black box.   Post-hoc interpretability for the ipeptidylprolyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene is supported e.g. by literature reports that this gene significant increases in differentiated carcinomas vs. normal or benign thyroid nodules at average 46 times.   However, the low univariate rankings of 2 of the 3 genes indicated that it was the genes combination, that resulted in good predictive power, and no attempt was made to explain such joint effect.

The feature selection method to distinguish benign from malignant samples consisted of two steps: a LIMMA linear model, and an iterative BMA algorithm.   The R package LIMMA was used  to  select  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes (fold-change cutoff of >=2 and a p-value<0.01). To minimize the number of signature genes, the iterative BMA R package was applied, which accounts for model uncertainty and the dependency between signature genes.    The BMA step was applied to further reduce the number of signature genes from 43 to 3, and thus the costs associated with microarrays and time-consuming data analysis.

	Yes, Data are available from the Clinical Research Committee of KOBIO under the Korean College of Rheumatology for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data	This study used data from the KOBIO registry, which is a nationwide multicenter cohort in Korea that was established to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of biologic therapies in patients with RA [13]. Patients in the registry were recruited from 38 hospitals since 2012, and their demographics, medications, comorbidities, extra-articular manifestations, disease activities, radiographic findings, and laboratory findings performed within 4 weeks prior to the patient’s visit were recorded with the date. The data from patients who were followed up annually were recorded on the KOBIO website (http://www.kobio.or.kr/kobio/), and these patients provided informed consent prior to registration. Ethical approval of the KOBIO-RA was obtained from the institutional review boards of all 38 participating institutions, including the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital (PAIK 2018-11-005).

Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if “yes” and 0 if “no” or “no test” because “no” was the most common value.	To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.	no	a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters.

Starting_TSV	Not applicable.	The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) using the “createDataPartition” function part of the caret package in R (version 3.2.4 for iOS).  Each model was trained with 10-fold cross-validation.    The random splitting of the data, model training, and assessment on the test set were performed 100 times to ascertain the variance of each model due to the random data splitting.			No.	Four approaches were compared: LR, MARS, ANN, RF.  Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa-metrics, and Brier score.  The best measures were those of RF.	Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa metrics, and Brier score. The AUROC of the RF model was highest at 0.74, significantly higher than LR (with a value of 0.57) but not significantly different from the ANN or MARS models.   LR had a very low kappa value (0.16), while RF had kappa values between 0.43 and 0.57, higher than ANN and MARS values of between 0.35 and 0.5 and, therefore, has the best prediction potential among the four models tested in this study based on the kappa metric.	Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUROC.	Cross-validation.			 Standard algorithms were used. 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   LR and MARS are generally considered interpretable models, while ANN and RF are generally considered not interpretable.    Post-hoc feature importance analysis indicated as the most important ones soil moisture, precipitation, and air temperature (LR model), or soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation (MARS, ANN, RF models) -- all of them in line with conclusions found in experimental literature.	Classification (binary prediction).  The continuous output of the LR, MARS, ANN was assigned as 'close to 1' or 'close to 0'.			Four approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF). 	No	Not reported.	Exploratory data analyses resulted in removal of correlated predictors (±0.90).   In the end, 7 predictors were used (i.e. 7 types of environmental data -- air temperature, relative humidity, etc).  The “varImp” function contained in the caret package was used to determine the relative predictor importance for each model. Each model was run using 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 predictors. The most important variables were selected for the development of the final model.	Over-fitting in MARS and ANN was discussed and prevented.   In LR and RF, over-fitting should not have been an issue.  Possible underfitting was probabiy there for LR, which, with a kappa of 0.16, indicated a low degree of similarity, between observed and predicted, beyond random chance.	No.	For LR, MARS, RF, the authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.   For ANN, weights can be deduced to have been in the range of 100. Their number depended on the number of nodes in the hidden layer, which was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUROC curve for model assessment.	For MARS, the forward stepwise algorithm leads to an overfitted model which is then run through a backward stepwise algorithm where basis functions that contribute the least are removed (Friedman1991).   For RF,  to reduce overfitting, the tree was often pruned, resulting in a smaller tree with fewer splits. This was accomplished using the Gini index, which is a measure of variance across all classes—smaller values mean a more accurate prediction at that node.			65faa4f792c76639b82bab29	28696170			Harteveld DOC, Grant MR, Pscheidt JW, Peever TL.

	no.	2 large sleep EEG data sets: the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sleep lab data set (N = 2532; ages 18-80); and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS, N =1974; ages 40-80)	Starting_TSV	They maintain strict separation of training and testing participants.	The MGH data set (N =2532) was partitioned into a healthy training set (N = 1343) used to train the model, and a testing set (N =1189) to evaluate model performance.  As validation, they used a subset of the SHHS data set where each participant underwent 2 study visits, referred as SHHS1 and SHHS2. The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set.			no.	no.	The method reports statistical significant results.		The model is validated on a longitudinal cohort from a subset of the SHHS data set without neurological or cardiovascular disease.			no.		Transparent. The use of a parametric model, improves model interpretation by inspecting each EEG feature and comparing to the age norm for each feature explicitly. An example is provided in Figure 5 of the paper.	Regression.			Novel approach: They develop a machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets. The model is described in the paper.	yes, included in the paper.	EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts. For 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is 7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.	They extract 102 features from each 30-second epoch covering both time and frequency domains. For each EEG recording, they average the features in each of the 5 sleep stages overtime, yielding 102 x 5 = 510 features per EEG.	One strength of the study is the use of large data sets. The number of EEGs involved in this study is large among relevant “BA” studies. The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the model performs.	no.	one. To determine the optimal hyperparameter, they randomly select 300 EEGs from the training set to serve as internal validation data.				6312169df3794236aa987a03	30448611	PMC6478501		Sun H, Paixao L, Oliva JT, Goparaju B, Carvalho DZ, van Leeuwen KG, Akeju O, Thomas RJ, Cash SS, Bianchi MT, Westover MB.

Feature dimensionality was reduced by the mRMR algorithm42 using R package mRMRe. mRMR has been shown to be a robust feature selection algorithm in various tasks43,44,45. The mRMR algorithm was applied to all image features with regard to the class label of sample (i.e., TFE3-RCC or ccRCC) to select an informative and non-redundant set of features.
