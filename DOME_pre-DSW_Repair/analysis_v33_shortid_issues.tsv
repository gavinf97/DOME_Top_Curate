Not applicable 	Not applicable 	4.0	0.0	No	Yes, our method was compared with two internal validation measures: (1) segmentation was evaluated by how closely it resembled the low-dimension overview of the high‐dimensional molecular content of MSI data obtained by nonlinear dimension reduction techniques (here we used UMAP). The resemblance between the UMAP image and the segmentation maps was measured by applying a Canny edge detector to both and computing their edge correlation.  (2) the Davies–Bouldin index (DBI) was used to find the optimal segmentation for MSI data. DBI measures the ratio of within-cluster distances (the measure of intra-cluster compactness) to between-cluster distances (the measure of inter-cluster separation), so a smaller DBI indicates better-defined clusters and thus supposedly better segmentation. 	not applicable 	Cohen's kappa score between MSI- and Histology-segmentation results	A multimodal fusion-based method was proposed in our manuscript.

This data can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110357."""	The datasets were obtained from the study of Pastushenko et al (2018) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110357. The number of data points (mouse Tumor Cells (TCs), each one with single-cell gene expression profiles) was 383.  The datapoints of the 1° dataset were 71 epithelial YFP + Epcam + skin squamous cell carcinoma TCs and the datapoints of the 2° dataset were 312 mesenchymal-like YFP + Epcam − skin squamous cell carcinoma TCs.   Epithelial YFP + Epcam + TCs and mesenchymal-like YFP + Epcam − TCs represent different EMT (Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition states.   Gene expression differences may reveal the cascade mechanisms of tumor migration and invasion.	Not applicable.	10 fold cross validation.   To balance the two datasets, so that the numbers of epithelial tumor and mesenchymal TCs were equal, the tool “SMOTE” (Synthetic Minority Over-samplingTEchnique) in Weka was used, to generate new samples in the class of epithelial TC.   	4.0	0.0	Not available	No comparisons.	No confidence intervals for MCC were reported.	MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient).	Cross-validation.   There were no independent datasets or novel experiments.	5.0	0.0	The algorithms and software packages used in this publication were all standard or already published.	No reported.	"According to the Authors, ""SVM and RF are “blackbox” methods. [...] RIPPER can generate interpretable classification rules.""    Ante-hoc techniques for transparency in SVM and RF were not applied, since feature selection was performed in a completely automatic manner.  Post-hoc analysis was partially interpretable, since several of the selected features were genes already known to be involved in the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.  In addition, GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment results were consistent with the known differences between epithelial and mesenchymal cells."	Binary classification (the optimal set of genes (features) should be able to clearly separate Epithelial from Mesenchymal cell status).  	4.0	0.0	Standard Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were used.   In addition, repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) was applied to produce classification rules for classifying samples from different TCs.  	Not reported.	Each TC was encoded with the expression levels of 49,585 genes.	"
Boruta feature selection (Kursa and Rudnicki (2010) J. Statist. Softw. Artic. 36, 1–13) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method (Peng et al (2005) IEEE Transact. Patt. Anal. Mach. Intel. 27, 1226–1238) were used, to evaluate the importance of each feature. Key features were then selected, and fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) with supervised classifiers to identify the optimal gene signatures for screening different TCs.   The IFS was run with SVM, RIPPER, and RF, respectively.   The optimal numbers of features turned out to be 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).
"	After SMOTE application, the number of datapoints was 624.    The Authors first used Boruta to select relevant features, resulting in 237 features (genes). After mRMR and IFS, the subsets of features with the optimal classification performance were obtained.  The numbers of features were 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).     Given the very high Accuracy (>= 0.979) and MCC (>= 0.934) values, obtained with all three classifiers, the methods seem to be at risk of overfitting.   While the high number of features could be a reason for the probable overfitting in SVM and RF, the RIPPER model might eventually have had different sources of overfitting.

Not applicable	SVM model with linear kernel was generated by a 10 fold repeated three-fold cross validation.  The RF model was generated by a 3-fold cross validation method repeated 100 times.			No.	The performances of the SVM and RF models were compared to the predicting performance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a simple biomarker for DKD which has been widely used so far.	The authors state that the AUROC of the two classifiers (SVM and RF) differed significantly from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (likelihood ratio test: p-value < 0.05). However, for the RF AUROC (value = 1.0) no confidence intervals are reported, and the confidence intervals for SVM AUROC are not further specified.	AUROC.  Comparison of disease prediction scores.	Cross-validation.   Since the authors were unable to find a benchmarking study in the discovery of urine protein biomarkers, they evaluated the models with mRNA expression in the kidney.   The SVM and RF models consisting of 5 urine proteins were applied to 4 publicly available GEO datasets:  GSE99339, GSE47185, GSE30122, and GSE96804.  However, the predictions on such datasets were not statistically significant.			Data were analyzed using the publicly available RStudio (version 1.1.456) including R (version 3.6.0). 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   The RF and SVM are generally considered black box.   Post-hoc analysis resulted somewhat interpretable, since the 5 selected features correspond to 5 urinary proteins that are considered likely to be related to DKD.  However, their eventual joint effect remains not interpretable.	Binary classification (PPG or GPG).  The binary results of RF and SVM models were also transformed in disease prediction scores, which ranged from 0 to 1.			SVM and RF.	No.	Not reported.	The study focused on 412 proteins (of the 1296 identified proteins in each proteome) quantified in more than 80% of urine samples, with missing values filled by local least squares imputation.  From those 412 proteins, 5 proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. 	The authors do not mention overfitting issues, although their multivariate AUROCs showed very high values.	No.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.  They mention the value of some parameters, without mentioning how they were chosen.
