	Not available	Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data from 311 HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.  1)        Patients were classified into two groups based on HER2 expression level. Npos=279 patients with tumours that showed HER2 protein overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+; IHC group). Nneg=32 patients with tumours that showed HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH in the absence of protein overexpression on IHC (IHC 2+ or 1+ to 2+; FISH group). 2)        Npos=188 patients with pathologic complete response (pCR), which was defined as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/isN0) at surgical resection. Nneg=123 patients that are non-pCR. 	Inclusion criteria for this study were HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients who underwent NAC and pretreatment state-of-the-art contrast-enhanced breast MRI. 70 were excluded because they did not have pretreatment breast MRI and 64 patients with outside images were excluded because of poor image quality.	For the prediction of pathological complete response, the data was split into training and test sets at a ratio of 4:1 (80% training and 20% test), with feature selection performed purely on the training set. Npos,train=150 patients with pCR. Npos,test=38 patients with pCR. Nneg,train=99 patients with non-pCR. Nneg,test=24 patients with non-pCR.  Due to the low number of cases in the minority class, this was not feasible for the comparison between the IHC and FISH groups.

Assessing the presence of statistically significant differences, using Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-squared test, across clinical and MRI features of 1) IHC vs FISH and 2) pCR vs non-pCR groups, before including them to the final model.	1) Binary predictions of IHC (positive) or FISH (negative) samples. 2) Binary predictions of pCR (positive) or non-pCR (negative) samples. 			Coarse decision trees	Not available	Following ROC and correlation analysis, Breast MRIs were assessed according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon.  Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-SNAP software.  Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours.   Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.  Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.  Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.  Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed. 	1) The final model to predict HER2 intratumour expression levels (IHC vs. FISH) utilized three MRI features. Lesion type and multifocality (clinical features) and large zone emphasis (radiomic feature). 2) The model to predict pCR status included six MRI parameters. Lesion type and size (clinical parameters) and variance, first order entropy, 90th percentile and zone length variance (radiomic parameters).
