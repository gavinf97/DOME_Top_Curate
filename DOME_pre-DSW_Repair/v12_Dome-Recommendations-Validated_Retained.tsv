Such unsupervised ML algorithm is a convolutional adversarial network (they call that ""MS-AdaNet"").  They train and test MS-AdaNet on a independent dataset to prove its ability in extrating features. However they trained this algorithm also on the dataset use for classification when the MS-AdaNet is used as input for the classifier."	Not stated.

No.	A transcriptional ‘risk metrics’ for ACPA-negative patients was bild, and the AUROC curve of the 12-gene signature was compared to the existing ‘Leiden prediction rule’ as a predictor of RA in the test set.   No difference in the performance was seen in this case.  However, by combining all features of the Leiden prediction rule with the 12-gene risk metric, and applying it to the ACPA-negative UA cohort (test set), the AUROC curve value improved from 0.74, SEM=0.08 (original Leiden prediction rule) to 0.84; SEM=0.06 (modified metric incorporating gene signature).

No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   SVM is generally considered black box.
