"	The source of the data is from a database we compiled, the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD) (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/). VPOD_1.0 is a new database, available on GitHub, that currently includes all heterologously expressed animal opsins. We refer to a subset of the database with only heterologous data as VPOD_het_1.0, although for version 1.0, this is synonymous with the entire database. VPOD_het_1.0 relies on 68 publications, mainly primary sources, with dates ranging from the 1980’s to 2023. The database contains opsin sequences and phenotype data from 166 unique species (counting 35 reconstructed ancestors), including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, and bivalves. Altogether, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values.	"We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0 (n=280). Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0)(n=91) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0)(n=352). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0)(n=721) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0)(n=143). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’.

"	For model training, a whole dataset it submitted to the algorithm training pipeline and it is randomly sampled to split the data such  that 80% is used for training, and 20% is used for model validation. The amount of data points in these splits/sets are dependent on the subset of data used to train the models. As mentioned earlier, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values. From this we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods.	4.0	0.0	Yes, this all available on our GitHub repository, (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/).	We didn't compare to an existing publicly available ML methods. However, we compared performance of ML models to phylogenetic imputation, which estimates phenotypes using phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding λmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed λmax values using phylogenetic imputation. We used the phylogenetic imputation sub-module of the phytools R package for performing imputation. We compared imputed and actual λmax using regression. 	No	The default performance metrics for regression and classification that deepBreaks uses are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-score. The default list of metrics that deepBreaks reports are provided in the documentation provide predefined custom metrics or a set of metrics from the scikit-learn library in python.	"For model evaluation and comparison, deepBreaks by default uses a 10-fold cross-validation approach and ranks
the models based on their average cross-validation score.
As we described in the methods of the main text ""we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity (Table 1) to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods. We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). 
Using various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5).

All data and code (software) is covered under a GNU General Public License (Version 3), in accordance with Open Source Initiative (OSI)-policies. 	A single representative prediction, all the way to several hundred predictions, takes only a matter of seconds to complete on a normal desktop PC.  Additionally, training the models can completed in a matter of minutes on a desktop PC as well.  	"All models used are generally interpretable, primarily due to the nature of the feature selection process, treating each position on an amino acid sequence as a feature. 
For interpreting the contribution of sequence positions to the predictive models, we use the feature importance, coefficients, and weights as different algorithms have different kinds of
output. For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree. For AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, extra tree, and
gradient boosting the importance of a feature is its Gini importance which is computed as the
normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature."	The models used for our paper were all regression, but deepBreaks provides the option to also train classification models in an identical manner. 	4.0	0.0	We then trained various ML models employing a custom version of deepBreaks, an ML tool designed for exploring genotype-phenotype associations. For continuous phenotypes, deepBreaks fit models using twelve different existing ML linear regression algorithms including, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Lasso Least Angle Regression, Huber Regressor, Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees), Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightgbm), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. deepBreaks takes aligned genotype data (DNA, RNA, Amino Acid) and some measure(s) of corresponding continuous or categorical phenotype data as input to train ML models. 	Yes, they are likely available in the scikit-learn documentation. 	The deepBreaks pipeline for preprocessing starts with dropping columns in the dataset that contain missing values over a certain threshold. The default threshold is 80% of the number of samples.  Dropping the zero-entropy (constant) features from the dataset, is the next step.   deepBreaks uses one-hot encoding to convert amino acid sequences into numerical values. One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V. The models cannot distinguish the input whether it's T or other unseen amino acids at that site.  	"The number of input features is variable depending on the length of the sequences following sequences alignment and the many preprocessing and feature selection steps. deepBreaks uses the Kruskal-Wallis tests (for continuous phenotypes)  to reduce the number of positions in the training data set and drop the redundant ones. This statistical test is used to assess the significance of each position by running tests on all the positions against the phenotype one by one. Those features where the p-value of their test against the phenotype is less than a threshold (default p-value = 0.25) will be dropped. A list of all features and their test p-values are provided a report to the user. Then, since deepBreaks considers each position in the sequences as a feature of our training dataset,  it checks for collinearity between our predictive variables, as it can cause issues for parameter estimation. To check for the relationship between

No	For all of the above-mentioned models deepBreaks by default uses the default hyperparameters from the scikit-learn library in python and a grid search (expandable by user preference) parameter set that is provided in the documentation.	We did not directly impliment any regularization measures, however I know certain models like the Light Gradient Boosted Machine and Xtreme Gradient Boosted Machine algorithms have regularization terms/parameters to limit overfitting.  That said, more information on this can be found in the scikit-learn documentation or in the corresponding literature for each machine learning algorithm type. 	7.0	1.0	65d6a5c492c76639b881cd51	na			Seth A.

For each drug-disease pair, their embeddings are concatenated and used as input for a Random Forest model to predict drug repurposing.	The knowledge graph node features are generated via the PubMedBERT model and GraphSage. The dimension of each node feature embedding is 512. There is no manual feature selection needed for this case. The random forest model selects the features by itself. Yes, the model selection via random forest is performed using the training set only.	The training data is larger than p but the underfitting problem was ruled out via the setting of using maximum depth of 35 and the number of tress of 200 in the random forest.	No, the model uses the training data that are collected by ourselves. The training data is independent of the test data.	There are 9 hyper-parameters used in unsupervised GraphSAGE embedding training which are selected manually while 2 hyper-parameters are used in the random forest which are selected via grid search algorithm.  The remaining hyper-parameters are set to default values.	There are a few overfitting prevention techniques used in the KGML-xDTD model which includes subsampling and feature selection by the random forest model, early stopping using a validation set in the reinforcement learning model.	8.0	0.0	670e3894908d74f9cb330ede	37602759			Chunyu Ma, Zhihan Zhou, Han Liu, David Koslicki	GigaScience	KGML-xDTD: a knowledge graph–based machine learning framework for drug treatment prediction and mechanism description 	10.1093/gigascience/giad057	2023	0.0	6.0		1.0	2024-10-15T09:40:36.120Z	2024-10-15T09:40:36.120Z	3cd05870-401b-496e-9b88-edc18d906026	undenfined	zg83kd0vmv

n=1045 (126, equal Npos and Nneg)"	As we used a (nested) cross-validation and thus the training and test sets are independent of each other. To account for the dependence structure across CV repeats when comparing CV outcomes of two ML models, we used the Bayesian ROPE approach which is specifically designed for this purpose.  	All data splits for the main analyses were performed using repeated k-fold cross-validation (k=5, repeats=10). In case of classification we used a stratified folds to preserve distributions of the data in training and test sets. If hyperparameter tuning was needed, we uses a nested cross-validation with the outer loop used for model assessment as described above and an inner 5-fold CV was used for model selection. We did not plot each of these distributions for our 11 datasets.	4.0	0.0	The code is available here: https://github.com/juaml/ConfoundLeakage under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0	We compare the performance of each ML algorithm with and without confound removal. We do not make any claims of performing better on the data than other algorithms. Still, we included a baseline model (dummy classifier/regressor) to evaluate performance not informed by the feature target relationship.	We report statistically meaningful results using the Bayesian ROPE approach. We also add standard deviations over repeats which could convey similar information as confidence intervals.	We report predictive r² for regression tasks and AUCROC for classification tasks. They are representative of what is common and reommended in the literature.

To generate the image datasets required for a DL model, we conducted a spheroid gel contraction assay using 5000 Smooth Muscle Cells (SMCs) and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells per collagen spheroid. After the collagen droplet had polymerized, we changed the medium and transferred the plates to an Incucyte Live-Cell Analysis System, which captured images of the spheroids every hour for a duration of 24 hours. Additionally, we employed a ZEISS Axio Vert.A1 Inverted Microscope to manually capture images of the spheroids at specific time points. By utilizing both methods, we were able to collect a diverse range of spheroid images, resulting in a robust dataset for our DL model. We obtained a total of 530 images from the Incucyte system and 432 images from the microscope.	The training, validation, and test sets are independent of each other. Furthermore, the spheroids in the test dataset underwent different treatment compared to those in the training and validation datasets.

To validate the performance improvement/consistence, we compare with public, simple algorithm which is Linear SVM based RFE without any special preprocessing method. 	To prove the low variability of performance, the standard deviation of performance is written together with average in Supplementary Tables. Variability is rounded to two decimal places. 	To validate the evaluation, we check various performance indexes (MCC, AUC, accuracy, PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity) and stability indexes (rank based stability measurement-number of common features, Pearson Correlation, Canberra Distance, Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity). Evaluation is done by test dataset obtained from following process: merging benchmark datasets and splitting into training dataset and test dataset by random sort(bootstrapping). 	As illustrated in Fig.1, we divided the entire dataset into Ensemble Dataset 1 and Ensemble Dataset 2. And each ensemble dataset was divided to training set and test set.

In this project, we utilized four different publicly available datasets that are well recognized in the domain. The first dataset consisted of mRNA data obtained from a study on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, measuring their transcriptome profiles. The second dataset was collected from a cervical cancer study that analyzed the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. The third and fourth datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from patients with Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA).

In this project, we utilized six different publicly available datasets that are well recognized in the domain. The first dataset consisted of mRNA data obtained from a study on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, measuring their transcriptome profiles. The second dataset was collected from a cervical cancer study that analyzed the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. The third and fourth datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from patients with Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA). 
  <br>
  <br>


The fifth dataset consists of scRNA-seq data obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were sequenced using 10× chromium technology. Among all the cell populations described in this study, we specifically utilized the scRNA datasets of CD8+ naïve, CD14+, and CD16+ monocytes (n=1500) with the goal of identifying distinct markers for each of these cell populations. The sixth dataset used in this study was the widely recognized Glass Identification dataset obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) ML repository.

"	We retained an independent dataset to evaluate the performance of the model for each dataset. The original datasets were divided randomly but in a stratified manner, with 70% allocated to the training dataset and 30% allocated to the test dataset.	We kept a separate test/validation dataset to assess the model's performance on each dataset. The initial datasets were randomly divided, but in a way that preserved proportional representation of each class in the given dataset, with 70% assigned to the training and 30% assigned to the test dataset.	4.0	0.0	All the trained models and corresponding performance results are available on (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8073635) under the Creative Commons - CC0 license.	We compared the performance of our trained models with a dummy classifier, which is a classifier that makes random predictions. Typically, it is expected that the trained models will outperform the dummy classifier. This serves as a baseline comparison to assess the effectiveness and superiority of our trained models. By comparing the performance metrics of our models against the random predictions of the dummy classifier, we can evaluate the added value and efficacy of our trained models in making accurate predictions.	No.	We computed more than 10 evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), for each trained model across all datasets. This comprehensive approach enabled us to gain a thorough understanding of the model's performance from multiple angles and perspectives	We consistently maintained an independent test set for all datasets to evaluate the model performance accurately. In addition, we employed multiple model evaluation techniques such as repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation, nested cross-validation, and others. These techniques allow for robust and reliable assessment of the models, taking into account the variance and potential bias in the data. By utilizing such methods, we aimed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance across different folds and iterations, enhancing the reliability of our results.	4.0	1.0	The source code for MLme is available at https://github.com/FunctionalUrology/MLme with GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

For the CLL patients dataset, we exclusively utilized the top 5,000 most variable mRNAs, excluding genes from the Y chromosome, as input for ML pipeline. As for the BRCA mRNA dataset, we concentrated solely on differentially expressed genes identified by edgeR, with a threshold of FDR ≤ 0.001 and logFC > ± 2.  For the PBMC dataset, we utilized only 500 highly variable genes across the three cell populations. For all other datasets, we employed them as they were originally available without any modifications.	To evaluate MLme, we utilized datasets ranging from 10 features to 5000 features. Feature selection was performed on all the datasets, but we always maintained an independent dataset solely for evaluating the model's performance. It's important to note that this independent dataset was not used for any kind of preprocessing or model training.	We consistently maintained an independent test set for all datasets in order to evaluate the model's performance and determine if there was any overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, we employed cross-validation methods and feature selection techniques to mitigate the risk of overfitting. These measures helped ensure a more reliable assessment of the model's generalization capabilities and minimize the influence of biased or noisy data.	The ML pipeline employed in this project incorporates several preprocessing steps, including data resampling and feature selection. These steps are followed by model training and evaluation. To prevent any potential data leakage, we perform data preparation within cross validation folds. Additionally, we maintain an independent test dataset to ensure accurate and unbiased evaluation.	The majority of the trained models were utilized with their default parameters.	We employed cross-validation methods and feature selection techniques to mitigate the risk of overfitting. These measures helped ensure a more reliable assessment of the model's generalization capabilities and minimize the influence of biased or noisy data.	8.0	0.0	670e3b6e908d74f9cb331be6	38206587			Akshay Akshay, Mitali Katoch, Navid Shekarchizadeh, Masoud Abedi, Ankush Sharma, Fiona C Burkhard, Rosalyn M Adam, Katia Monastyrskaya, Ali Hashemi Gheinani	GigaScience	Machine Learning Made Easy (MLme): a comprehensive toolkit for machine learning–driven data analysis	10.1093/gigascience/giad111	2024	0.0	6.0		1.0	2024-10-15T12:58:46.423Z	2024-10-15T12:58:46.423Z	bb9e3878-75dc-4120-88f4-0a98f0195ec1	undenfined	bxlfk5g20v

The source of the dataset is INfrastructure for a PHAge REference Database (INPHARED) provided by https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared on Aug 1st, 2022. There are 3,659 bacteriophage genomes in this dataset. We curated 1912 tailspike protein sequences and 200732 non-tailspike protein sequences from this dataset. This data has not been used in previous papers.	To train and validate the SpikeHunter the manually curated set of tailspike proteins was first clustered into 20,274 clusters at 30% identity using CD-HIT. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing datasets in a ratio of 3:1:1 using the StratifiedGroupKFold function in the Scikit-learn python package, with two key objectives in mind: 1) ensuring the absence of overlaps among protein clusters, and 2) maintaining consistent ratios of positive to negative samples across the splits. As a result of this process, the training, validation and test sets are independent.	The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing datasets in a ratio of 3:1:1. The training set includes 122,506 proteins (comprising 1,023 positive samples and 121,483 negative samples belonging to 12,170 clusters), a validation set 40,838 proteins (comprising 343 positive samples and 40,495 negative samples belonging to 4,054 clusters), and a test set 39,300 proteins (comprising 546 positive samples and 38,754 negative samples belonging to 4,050 clusters).	4.0	0.0	Yes.

This embedding layer is then linked to a neural network comprising three fully connected layers with 1280, 568, and 2 nodes, respectively. The output layer employs a softmax activation function to produce probabilities, indicating whether each sequence corresponds to a tailspike protein or not.	Yes. The deep-learning model trained in this study is provided at https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/SpikeHunter_trained_model_pth_file/23577051.	Phage protein sequences were tokenized and transformed into numerical vectors using the batch_converter function in the ESM Python package (https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm).	Since the sequences are embedded as 1280-length representations using a pre-trained transformer protein language model ESM-2 during training, the number of input features before embedding varies depending on the lengths of protein sequences, while the number of features after the embedding is 1280. No feature selection strategy was performed.	The model's parameter count is approximately eight times the number of training data points. Early stopping was adopted to stop training once the model performance was no longer improved on the validation dataset for three consecutive epochs to avoid overfitting.

When training the four MOB classification models suitable for different length ranges, the training and testing sets were randomly split in a 7:3 ratio. There was no overlap between the training and testing sets; they were independent of each other.	When training plasmid DNA word vectors based on the Skip-gram language model, MOBFinder utilized a total of 37,139 plasmid genomes. For training the four MOB classification models, this study obtained the complete plasmid genomes from the NCBI database again and annotated them with MOB typing using the relaxase database. Subsequently, 67,925 plasmid genomes determined by MOB typing were used to simulate plasmid assembly fragments from metagenomic datasets for training the MOB classification models	4.0	0.0	 The evaluation script for this tool will be uploaded to the relevant database after the article is published. You can access the MOBFinder tool from Github: https://github.com/FengTaoSMU/MOBFinder.	As there are currently no benchmark datasets for metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, this study constructed one from scratch and compared it with existing tools like MOB-suite and MOBscan.	The evaluation metrics used in this study range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the lowest performance and 1 indicating the highest. MOBFinder's performance surpasses existing tools significantly, with an overall accuracy at least 59% higher than MOB-suite and at least 61% higher than MOBscan.

Classification.	4.0	0.0	The machine learning algorithms used in this study are the Skip-gram language model and Random Forest. Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. In some cases, F1 and AUC scores reached as high as 0.99, almost perfect.	According to our test results, MOBFinder takes approximately 5 to 18 minutes to predict on the test set, depending on the length and quantity of input data.	"1.

Training of the MOB classification model: This study utilized known relaxases of MOB types to perform MOB typing on plasmid genomes, selecting plasmid genomes with confirmed MOB types based on their scores to construct benchmark datasets. For each MOB type of plasmid genome, the training and testing sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio. The training set for each MOB type randomly generated 90,000 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, while the testing set for each MOB type randomly generated 500 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. All fragments were encoded using the generated 4-mer word vectors, with the average 100-dimensional word vector calculated as input for training the Random Forest model."	This tool did not conduct feature selection; instead, it used 100 word vector features trained by the skip-gram model as input.	The number of each MOB type in the training dataset is the same, and random forest was used to prevent overfitting.	No.	"1. The skip-gram model consists of two layers of neural networks: a hidden layer and an output layer, with 100 neurons in the hidden layer.

67333632a96b586fdb27231e	You can access to the curated RefSeq dataset with the link http://zenodo.org/records/14005015 (dataset.tar.gz), which is licensed under the CC0 license.	The data is all curated from the NCBI RefSeq database. There are 173,666, 99,945, 28,081 data points for the three GO categories, MF, BP, and CC, repectively (three sub-tasks). The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.	As described above, the generated test set can serve as a novel protein set compared to the training set. Specficially, the minimum normalized edit distances between the training set and the test set for most of the labels are larger than 0.7 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 in the manuscript).	There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO. Because of the large number of the binary classifications (377), we can't plot all the distributions. However, the data type distributions are roughly consistent for the training, validation, and test sets.	4.0	0.0	Yes, you can check the dataset used for benchmark experiments via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records /14005015.	Because the RefSeq test set we curated is to simulate the novel protein function prediction scenario, we didn't include any alignment-based tools for benchmarking, such as Diamond and BLASTP. Additionally, we conducted the benchmarking experiments with six learning-based state-of-the-art tools, including DeepGOPlus, PFresGO, TALE, DeepSeq, TM-Vec, and CaLM. For a fair comparison, we retrained all of them using our curated RefSeq dataset (training/validation/test). The results showed that PlasGO performed the best on all three GO categories (Figure 6 in the manuscript).	No. The two evaluation metrics do not relate to confidence intervals. For more details, please refer to the CAFA challanges.	"We used the two commonly used metrics in the CAFA challenge, namely the protein-centric Fmax and the term-centric AUPR. For more details of the two metrics, please refer to the ""Experimental setup"" section in the manuscript."	We conducted a series of rigorous experiments to evaluate the performance of PlasGO. All of them can be checked in the manuscript's Results part. Specifically, they include 1) the performance on the novel RefSeq test set, 2) two ablation studies for validating PlasGO’s design rationale, 3) visualization of the PlasGO embeddings for interpreting the BERT module, 4) identification of elusive GO term labels to improve the precision of PlasGO, 5) labels of different frequencies and confidence scores which show the performance stability on different labels and the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores, 6) application: automatic GO prediction for unannotated plasmid-encoded proteins in RefSeq, which pre-annotates high-confidence GO terms for all available plasmid proteins (678,197), 7) case study: annotations for two well-studied conjugative plasmids associated with AMR.	5.0	0.0	Yes. You can refer to the GitHub repository https://github.com/Orin-beep/PlasGO for most recent updates. Licensed under the MIT license.	The running speed of PlasGO is very fast. For the 365 plasmid proteins in the example data, it only took 1m48s for the GO term prediction on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. 	The model is interpretable. We mainly interpreted the global BERT module of PlasGO by comparing the raw embeddings generated from the ProtTrans model and the contextualized embeddings from the global BERT module. You can check the results from Figure 7 in the manuscript. The results showed thats suggests that PlasGO effectively captures the latent features associated with plasmid-specific functions.	Classification.	4.0	0.0	We employed deep learning in our tool. PlasGO consists of three sub-modules, a pre-trained protein language model, a global BERT model, and a classifier module incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The core part of PlasGO is the BERT model to learn the global context within plasmid sentences. We used the BERT model because we formuated plasmids as a language defined on the protein token set, and BERT is one of the state-of-the-art language models.	Yes, you can check PlasGO's default models (models.tar.gz) via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records/14005015, which is licensed under the CC0 license.	We employed the powerful foundation protein languange model, ProtTrans, to encode our input protein sequences. It can generate biologically meaningful embedding for each plasmid-encoded protein. Then, the raw input embeddings can greatly improve the performance of GO term prediction through transfer learning. 	"As described in V.3, the only input is the plasmid protein amino acid (AA) sequences. Then, ProtTrans is employed to generate the raw embeddings for each protein (preprocessing). By capturing the
semantic meaning of individual AA tokens and their contextual relationships within the protein sequence, ProtTrans will generate per-protein embeddings (1024 dimensions) as the input to the subsequent BERT module."	We have 89,835 plasmid sentences in total for training the simplified global BERT model with token classification task. As shown above, the simplest BERT model (CC) have hyperparameter of hidden_size=512, head_num=8, and layer_num=2. The corpus size (89,835) is sufficient to fit the BERT module. In addition, there are several overfitting strategies in the PlasGO models, which will be listed in V.7.	No. There is no data from other ML algorithms as input to PlasGO.	The parameter number is 13340504 for MF model, 13698908 for BP model, and 6891070 for CC model. Actually, the three models are all simple BERT models with hidden_size = 512, head_num = 8. Besides, we used 4 Transformer layers for MF and BP, and 2 Transformer layers for CC, considering the relatively smaller dataset size and label size for CC.	Yes. 1) Dropout layers adopted on both the classifier FC layer and also the attention blocks in the BERT model. 2) Validation set is employed to prevent overfitting. 3) Layer Normalization is employed for each Transformer block and also the token embedding layer. 4) A rank regularization method is utilized in the classifier module to promote the ability of the model to distinguish low-confidence and high-confidence predictions.

We referred to the classic data division method when training the VGAE model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07308v1). The dataset was split according to the positive and negative edges of the interaction network, and the training set and test set are independent. The positive edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 1) of the initial adjacency matrix were split by 90%, 5%, and 5% respectively and the same number of negative edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 0) were randomly selected to form the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively.	The gene-by-cell matrix contained an average of 66,395 cells (range 2,638 to 287,269) and 24,064 genes (range 13,714 to 33,694). The interaction network contained 977,356 interactions among 19,752 genes. The gene-by-cell matrix were adjusted to be consistent with the nodes of the interaction network. We deleted the genes that were not annotated in the interaction network and used 0 to fill in the node features that lacked feature values. The positive edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 1) of the initial adjacency matrix were split by 90%, 5%, and 5% respectively and the same number of negative edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 0) were randomly selected to form the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively.	4.0	0.0	Scripts that were used to perform the evaluation are available (https://github.com/LPH-BIG/scGraph2Vec).

Using a 64-core CPU in parallel, the total computation time was about 50 minutes, the peak memory usage was 64 gigabytes.	We demonstrate that gene embedding is biologically interpretable and can reveal functional gene modules representing general or tissue-specific cellular processes.

For each scRNA-seq dataset, we filtered for genes with a non-zero expression value in at least 3 cells and for cells with at least 200 expressed genes. The originally downloaded count data were transformed to log (counts per million + 1) values and scaled by all cells. 	On average, each scRNA-seq datasets contained 66,395 cells/features (ranging from 2,638 to 287,269) and 24,064 genes/nodes (ranging from 13,714 to 33,694).

No, this question is not applicable to our work.	The model has four hyperparameters specific to scGraph2Vec and some general parameters associated with GAE/VGAE. We carried out a hyperparameter sweep to examine the key hyperparameters of scGraph2Vec and the best hyperparameters were determined by using a combination of assessment parameters, including the silhouette coefficient, the number of clusters, and the running time.

For optimization runs we used a nested 5-fold CV, ensuring fair assessment of our results due to independent test datasets. When testing HVSeeker-DNA we additionally used subsets of our original independent test-set of different homology conditions to challenge our models. In the last step we test HVSeeker against a novel dataset based on the infant gut metagenome, showing it's utility in a practical setting.	5.0	0.0	The source code is released on github and can be found in the gigascience database aswell (MIT license included). To make it easier to run the scripts, we also supply a conda environment with instructions for easy installation. 	Executing a simple forward pass with one sequence only takes around 0.0366 seconds on a standard machine (cpu only). Prediction time is therfore neglegtible. 	As it is the case with most deep-learning methods, interpretaing the classification results is unfortunately not directly possible. 	The model performs classification. 	4.0	0.0	HVSeeker is based on established machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as LSTM and Transformer, which are known to work well with sequences and have been adapted to our specific problem	The model files, optimization schedule and paramter and hyperparameter configurations are reported and can be found in the gigascience database. 	HVSeeker relies on one-hot encoding but merges data in different ways, such as padding (cycling through the sequence until it reaches the required length), contig assembly (combining multiple shorter sequences to generate a longer sequence, then splitting it into subsequences of 1000 bp), and sliding window (using a window of 1000 bp to slide over the input DNA sequence in 100 bp steps)	Both versions of HVSeeker rely only on the sequence, the input features are therfore the nucleotides/amino acids of the input sequence. No further feature selection was performed.	We evaluate our models during training using a validation set to achieve an optimal fit of the paramters.	HVSeeker-Protein uses input from a pre-trained version of ProtBert. Since ProtBert was previously trained on a masked language task, it had not encountered a classification task prior to this study.	HVSeeker contains 1026152 trainable parameter. The number of parameter is a result of adapting the model to the training process. 	We use early stopping using a validation set and dropout to prevent overfitting to the training data.

These datasets can be downloaded from Google Drive and have been submitted along with the source code of TransHLA, including both training and testing data.	Independent	The ratio of the training set, validation set, and test set is 7:1:2. For HLA-II epitopes, there are 312,245 positive samples and 312,245 negative samples. For HLA-I epitopes, there are 459,442 positive samples and 459,442 negative samples. The document mentions that an independent validation set was indeed used, but it does not provide the specific number of samples in the validation set. To ensure the rationality of data distribution, the researchers examined the frequency distribution of HLA alleles that bind to peptides in the IEDB database. The results show that the frequency distribution of HLA alleles in the training set, validation set, and test set exhibits highly similar characteristics (see Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 5). Therefore, it can be concluded that the distribution of data types in the training set and test set is similar. The document notes that the distribution of data types for the training set, validation set, and test set has all been visualized. Specifically, Figure 2 shows the distribution of major HLA-I alleles across different datasets, while Supplementary Figure 5 displays the distribution of the top 50 alleles for HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP.	4.0	0.0	No	Yes, a comparison was performed against current SOTA software on benchmark datasets, as well as against simpler baselines.

The performance metrics reported include AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, accuracy, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, recall, precision, and specificity. These metrics provide a comprehensive and representative analysis, which is consistent with standards in the literature.	The method was evaluated using an independent dataset by splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1:2 ratio.

Black Box	classification	4.0	0.0	TransHLA employs a deep learning machine learning algorithm, specifically combining the Transformer architecture with Residue Convolutional Neural Networks (Residue CNN) to predict epitopes presented by HLA molecules. The novelty of this algorithm lies in its utilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, such as Transformers and ESM2 embeddings, to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency. This new approach was chosen over more traditional models due to its higher specificity and sensitivity in identifying immunogenic epitopes and novel epitopes. Moreover, by merging all epitopes into a single positive sample class and using negative samples in a 1:1 ratio during training, this method learns unified epitope features, enabling better differentiation between epitopes and regular peptide sequences. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also significantly reduces the need for chemical experiments, lowering costs, and demonstrating greater robustness and reliability in antigen selection tasks across diverse populations.	Yes, the hyperparameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are reported. You can find this information at the following URL: https://github.com/SkywalkerLuke/TransHLA. The repository includes details about the licensing as well.	The input data consists of sequences. The sequences are encoded using the ESM2 tokenizer, which converts characters into numerical representations. Then, these numerical representations are passed through ESM2 to generate embeddings. This process leverages the advanced modeling capabilities of ESM2 to create high-dimensional representations of the peptide sequences, which are essential for effective machine learning model training.	We use 2 pretrained embedding features (sequence embedding, structure) as input. We do not use feature selection, and we use the deep learning framework for abstract feature extraction.	The number of parameters is quite large, categorizing it as a large model. However, since a portion of these parameters comes from the pre-trained model, which has effectively extracted features in advance, this helps mitigate both overfitting and underfitting. During downstream training, we employed an early stopping mechanism and established conditions for when early stopping should commence, allowing us to save the best-performing model. This approach helps ensure that the model does not overfit to the training data while still maintaining sufficient capacity to learn effectively.	No, the model does not use data from other machine learning algorithms as input. The training data for the initial predictors and the meta-predictor are not clearly stated to be independent of the test data for the meta-predictor. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that they are independent.	The model uses approximately 700 million parameters. Of these, 650 million parameters are derived from the ESM2 pre-trained model. The remaining parameters are determined based on the size of the ESM2 embeddings and the number of layers in the model.	Yes, overfitting prevention techniques were used. Specifically, we employed a validation set along with an early stopping mechanism. This approach helps monitor the model's performance and stops training when improvements on the validation set cease, effectively preventing overfitting.	8.0	0.0	676005bbdd85bd59b37ec404				"Tianchi LU, Xueying Wang, Wan Nie, Miaozhe Huo, Shuaicheng LI

"	"This dataset contains annotated images of mature inflorescences, collected from experiments conducted on the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for Arabidopsis. These 2D RGB images are in png format, consist of branches of stems with fruits attached. The designated image-based tasks are for quantitative trait extraction for Arabidopsis fruits, and has been used to develop Cascade Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation. The annotations for an image consist of segmentation masks for individual instance of siliques and have been store in COCO format in json files, with only one class of object of interest, i.e. siliques. The number of silique object could vary from none to hundreds. 

This annotation dataset was curated for our AI pipeline for Arabidopsis fruit phenotyping, and has not be used in other work yet. "	The datasets were split randomly form two independent datasets: a training set and a test set without any shared examples between the two. 	"The annotated image dataset has been randomly split into two sets: training (44 images, with 2,288 annotated siliques) and test (11 images, with 652 silique segmentations).
The distributions of the training and test set are similar as they are from the same experiment and imaged under the same condition by a flatbed scanner. 

For the verification of the pipeline using QTL analysis, the full dataset collection (in total of over 7000 images) has been utilised.

No direct comparison on instance segmentation model is available at the moment, as this is a newly curated dataset for our AI pipeline development. Simpler alternative traits can be extracted using other easier to extract traits, by e.g. semantic segmentation algorithms, however it would not be a precise measurement on the silique morphology, as we hope for this work. 	Experiments for comparison to alternative methods have not been available. However, this development aims to demonstrate the potential of using AI based pipeline to for large scale fruit phenotyping, and we have done so by verifying the model-derived phenotypic outputs through QTL analysis. 	"We evaluated the trained model on an independent test set of 11 annotated images containing 652 siliques, using standard performance metrics for object detection and segmentation. These include Average Precision and Average Recall (with an IoU threshold ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05), as well as Precision at IoU thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75.

For independent verification of the instance silique segmentation model, the entire image collection (over 7000 images) was examined through qualitative inspection and QTL analysis to identify links between variability in model-derived fruit morphology phenotypes and the genome. Significant loci were then cross-referenced with known genes and relevant literature."

Only a few seconds or less are required to inference on the model to generate the segmentation predictions using a single desktop PC with CPU only, it is recommended to run on machine with larger RAM (e.g. 32 GB or above) is recommended. 	This model is a blackbox neural network model, however it's outputs (detected silique instances and corresponding masks) can be plotted overlaying the original images for visual inspection.

Direct model outputs for the instance segmentation problem include detected bounding boxes and segmentation masks for siliques and their associated confidence scores.	4.0	0.0	We chose Cascade Mask R-CNN for our instance segmentation tasks due to its multi-stage approach, which progressively refines detection, offering higher accuracy and improved handling of scale and occlusion compared to single-stage methods like YOLACT, which prioritise real-time processing over precision. While two-stage methods, including Mask R-CNN, provide a strong balance between detection precision and efficiency, additional integration of attention mechanisms, such as transformer architectures, can further enhance spatially aware segmentation but often require more computational resources and training data. Cascade Mask R-CNN’s ability to refine detections iteratively makes it particularly suitable for the challenges in agricultural imagery, such as dense scenes and varied scales.

We opted for end-to-end deep learning model architecture where features are automatically learned from the data. 	We initialise the weights without any parameter freezing to allow the model to adapt to the largely different domain of our dataset.   The model was trained for 36 epochs, most of the settings are set as default values, using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01. These hyper-parameters were chosen based on the internal validation (randomly split from the training set) performance, i.e. to allow the model to converge well without overfitting. We included an initial linear learning rate warm-up for the first 100 iterations, starting at 0.00001, and ending at the learning rate of 0.01. This was chosen to stop the sharp initial updates from the initial COCO weights, which can lead to instability \citep{glimer21}. The learning rate was set to decay by a factor of 0.1 at epochs 24 and 33 to allow for fine-tuning later in the training. Training took place across 4 GPUs. Batch size was set to 1 image for each GPU. 	No	Underlying Cascade Mask R-CNN, we used a RegNetX 1.6GF backbone \cite{radosavovic20} with a feature pyramid network.

Exclusions were applied to intubated patients, those under the influence of sedation medications, within a week post-operative, on ECMO support, or diagnosed with myelomeningocele. For all infants who were between 10-20 weeks post-term age (corrected for preterm birth, if applicable) at the time of a clinic visit, and whose parents or legal guardians agreed to video recording for clinical care, clinicians captured a 1-2 minute video of the infant lying in supine.

We also have supporting scripts for executing NeRFStudio models on this data on this Github Repo link: https://github.com/Lewis-Stuart-11/3D-Plant-View-Synthesis"	"We used a robot system to capture data of a set of different wheat plants, captured over a series of different timesteps. All individual data captured of each plant, at each timestep, was encapsulated into their own directories. 
The main data consists of RGB images and depth maps of each plant, captured from positions equidistance around the centre of each plant. Each position for each image was recorded and stored as a transform file and COLMAP point cloud, which ensures that these images can be utilised for 3D reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussian Splatting or other supported models/frameworks.
Approximately 320 images and depth maps were captured for each plant instance- this would vary depending on if the robot setup failed to reach some of the positions. For each of the plant instances, we also include all model weights and training parameters, which can be executed using NeRFStudio.
This dataset is novel and is introduced along with the supported manuscript. "	We chose to implement a 8:1 split between our training and evaluation (test) images. These images were added to each set sequentially during capturing, meaning that after 8 training images were captured, the next was added to the evaluation set. Our capturing process takes images around the plant in a linear path, meaning that the evaluation images were evenly distributed around the plant (resulting in accurate evaluation results). These splits are similar to other multi-view image datasets (such as the original NeRF Dataset).	"For each plant, there are around 35 images used for evaluation (284 images for training). These datasets were distributed evenly based on our capturing process (see IV.3).
Images assigned to the training set or evaluation sets are labelled with '_train' or '_eval' in each file name. Furthermore, separate transform files have been generated for both training and evaluation images. Validation sets are not required for training view synthesis models (at least in this instance)."	4.0	0.0	Yes, these are available on our dataset which is available via this link: [TO ADD].	No, we did not compare this to other datasets, since we are not providing that these NeRFStudio models are more efficient than other publicly available models.

Neural Radiance Field models utilise a neural network to represent a given scene, meaning that these models are black box. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting models utilise gradient descent to position, reshape and recolour a set of Gaussians to fit a complex scene.

NeRFStudio, a framework that offers functionality for training data on view synthesis models, was used for all training and evaluation of the dataset. We utilised two of their methods for training:
- NeRFacto: an implementation of NeRF that includes enhancements from various other established models

The data consists of 285 images (divided into 4 subgroups of different types of histological staining) for classification (pixel level segmentation of tissue from whole slide images). Each image consists of 640x640 pixels (409600 pixels). Each pixel is either categorized as 'tissue' or 'background'. The whole dataset consists of 116 736 000 pixels (85284725 pixels are 'tissue', 31 451 275 pixels are 'background'). In relative terms: 73.1% (std: 0.04) of all pixels are tissue area, and 26.9% (std: 0.04) are background area. The four staining subgroups were distributed as follows:

Hematoxylin and Eosin: 32 images
Hematoxylin, Erythrosine, and Saffron: 160 images
Masson's Trichrome staining: 32
Immunohistochemistry: 61

This dataset has not been used by other papers."	"In the final model the sets were split randomly (although with stratification to ensure class balance). The only factor that could be considered ""dependent"" between images is the type of histological staining. Other datasets with tissue annotation typically only include one type of stain (often hematoxylin and eosin, e.g., ORCA: https://sites.google.com/unibas.it/orca/home and CAMELYON16: https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and focus not on segmenting tissue from background, but provide tissue annotations for segmentation areas of medical interest within the tissue area. Therefore, they are not useful for our method which is evaluated to work on different types of staining."	"Since the task is tissue segmentation from images, we applied data splitting at an image level. The model was validated with two strategies to highlight robustness (explanation at ""Evaluation.Evaluation Method)

The final model used by the registration algorithm was trained on a 80/20 split (stratified split to ensure that distributions are similar).

1. Stratified Kfold cross validation with a 80/20 split with stratification for each type of staining.
2. Leave-one-tissuetype-out validation (train the model on 3 staining types and leave one staining type out) with a split according to the distribution noted in IV.1. This was done for analyzing the robustness. Example: When testing ""leave-one-tissuetype-out validation"" on immunohistochemistry, 224 images from the other 3 staining groups were used as training and the 61 images of immunohistochemistry were used as a test set.

It is used a preprocessing step in a registration pipeline. Tutorials for running the registration (and specifically the segmentation portion of the registration) can be found here: https://github.com/mwess/GreedyFHist/blob/master/examples/notebooks/pairwise.ipynb. Example data is available.	The model takes around 1.06 seconds on a desktop PC.	The model is based on a deep learning architecture and is therefore a black box model.	The model performs tissue segmentation which is a form of classification.	4.0	0.0	The ML algorithm is a deep learning architecture based on the pre-existing YOLO8 model (https://yolov8.com/) for segmentation. It was chosen because it is able to perform fast inference on a CPU which complements the rest of our CPU based registration algorithm.	The trained model is incorporated into our registration algorithm, GreedyFHist (https://github.com/mwess/GreedyFHist) and available under the MIT license. Default parameters were used to train the model.	Preprocessing: Images were resampled to a resolution of 640 x 640 and converted to grayscale. Spurious noise from the background of the image was removed using a method by Chambolle et al., that performs total variation denoising. Then we used the YOLO8 model to perform tissue segmentation on the image. After segmentation small artifacts were removed from mask and masks were rescaled to the input images original size.	Each input image consists of 640x640 (409600) pixel. No feature selection was done.	Since we train the model for pixel level classification our training points were 116 736 000 pixels and  3 157 200 parameters (ratio of 0.027). We evaluated our segmentation model with stratified kfold cross validation and leave-one-tissuetype-out validation before training the final model. All models performed similarly. 	No data from other ML algorithms is used as input.	The model was predefined with 3 157 200 parameters. By default, adjusting the number of parameters was not possible and therefore not done.	During training, image augmentation is used to generalize the dataset (Augmentation parameters can be found here: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#train-settings). Additional augmentation, mosaic augmentation (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/12/mosaic-data-augmentation/) is used as a means of improving the models robustness. This feature was disabled in the last 10 epochs of training (epochs 90 - 100). Because of that, no early stopping was used.	8.0	0.0	67bf7c28edf7b650399238cf				"Maximilian Wess

Dataset use by community: databases used are well recognised and the gold standard for the data types used. The evaluation data for CASP is also a standardised set of data for comparative benchmarking of protein structure prediction ML models."	"How were the sets split?: testing data from CASP14 is a completely unseen and diverse test data set used for benchmarking protein structure prediction.  This data is not allowed to be used for training.

Are the training and test sets independent?: yes 

How was this enforced:  pairwise sequence identity was taken into consideration.  Clustering sequences to avoid similar sequence identities in test considered. Authors address issue of sequence identity in biological data sets and sequence similarity is carefully controlled.

How does the distribution compare to previously published ML datasets?: using standard CASP14 rules this aligns to all other models participating in the competition. CASP has long history of addressing distribution of proteins in test.  "	"Data splits:
-Training: figures not explicitly stated in paper - can be inferred from various input file availability. Exact figures unclear also in supplementary material.

-Test: figures not explicitly stated paper - can be inferred from file availability and CAPS14 competition details.

Details on some of the main protein structure prediction performance measures:
Accuracy
Global Distance Test - Total Score
Root Mean Square Deviation 
TM-score 
Global Local Distance Difference Test 
Contact Score

Machine learning specific model performance measures:
AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): Used for assessing contact and distance predictions (evaluating classification of residue-residue contacts).
AUC-PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve): Used alongside AUC-ROC for imbalanced data in contact prediction.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures correlation between predicted and actual residue-residue distances.
Spearman Rank Correlation: Evaluates ranking consistency between predicted and actual distances.
PPV (Positive Predictive Value): Measures precision in predicting contacts.
Precision & Recall: Assesses accuracy of long-range contact predictions.

All data and code is covered under a MIT License. The analytic code is accessible from the GigaDB.	We collected 6,735 RNA viruses from Virus-Host Database and 126,417 records with host annotations from NCBI GenBank, both of which are widely used database. After the careful data preprocessings, including de-replication and removal of ambiguous host annotations, we finally got 14500 RNA viruses, spanning 30 virus orders and 12 host groups, including Invertebrate, Viridiplantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Primates, Rodentia, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Other mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, and Fish. We also evaluated our method in a set of newly-identified RNA viruses, whose hosts are derived based on experimental evidence. The set includes 126 RNA viruses and were collected from various hosts, including Plant, Invertebrate, Fungi, and Fish. The dataset is complied from 20 publications.	We evalaute the model by cross-validation, leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, which are not included in the training data. In all datasets, the training and test sets are independent. Before the evaluation, we remove the data redundancy to be less than 90% coverage and 80% identity. In leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, the sequence identity between training and test set is even lower. 	"We first evalute the learning architecture by stratified 5-fold cross validation. The viruses in corresponding virus orders are stratified splited into 5 folds by their labels, with 4 folds as training set and 1 as test set. We evaluated the models on each fold and average the results. There is no duplicate samples between the training and test datasets. 
Besides, we evaluated the models by conducting leave-one-genus-out experiments. Specifically, we used one genus as test set and viruses from other genuses as training set to assess the generalizability of the models. There are 448 virus genera in total. This experiment is a strong demonstration of the generality of the model; no viruses of the same genus are distributed in both the training and test data. "	4.0	0.0	They are availble in the GigaDB and supplementary information.	Yes, we set the alignment-based method, BLASTN, as the baseline model. We then further comared VirHost with various available learning-based methods and validated the outperforming accuracy of VirHost.	We evaluated all the benchmark models across virus orders by their accuracy distribution. VirHost outperformed any other models from the average accuracy. We also tested confidence of the superior accuracy by one-sided Wilcoxon test, which gave p-value smaller then 0.005	We used accuracy, precision, and prediction rate and the performance metrics in this study. These metrics are widely used in previous studies, like DOI:10.1126/science.aap9072 and doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab33 .	We extensively assessed the models by stratified 5-fold cross evaluation, leave-one-genus-out experiment, and recently-identified novel RNA viuses.	5.0	0.0	It can be access by https://github.com/GreyGuoweiChen/VirHost	It takes around 5 seconds to run the test cases (3 viruses) on a normal desktop PC.	The models are black box models. But we provide the evidence and different confidence level of our predictions to users.	We build hierarchical classification models for each virus order.	4.0	0.0	We designated XGBoost as the learning architecture out of its superiors accuracy and training efficiency. To validate our choice, we conducted an evaluation of several learning architectures, encompassing XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). Using the scikit-learn and xgboost package, default parameters were employed to train these models, and their performance was assessed using accuracy as the evaluation metric.	"All of the model configuration can be easily access from the scikit-learn and xgboost documentation. If you wanna check the parameters of our models, you may load the models by pickle package and used the command ""model.get_xgb_params()"""	We encode the query sequences by their genomic traits and sequence homology. Specifically, we encode the sequences into a (137+m) dimensional vector as the input to models, where m is the number of host labels in the corresponding virus order and model layer. The genomic traits is vectorized as a 137-dimensional vector. To encode the m feature, we first group the reference viruses by their host labels, and then align the query virus against the reference viruses. The highest similarity score against each group is kept to be the corresponding feature value.	Two groups of feature are used as input, 137 genomic traits and the viral sequence homology. Although we did feature selection, we simply compared the feature contribution and model accuracy between the 137 genomic tratis and the codon pairs groups. This is done in the cross validation experiment. For a fair comparison, we removed all of the codon pair scores without using any relatively important ones, which will not result in the data leakage.	We did not focus on ruling out overfitting or underfitting. However, it is worth noting that the parameter count of XGBoost is typically lower than that of neural networks. Additionally, XGBoost incorporates L2 regularization by default, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting.	No.	For all of the above-mentioned models, we use the default hyperparameters from scikit-learn and xgboost library to train.	XGBoost incorporates L2 regularization by default, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting. Besides, we adopted the early stop strategy by evaluating the prediction probability of our models. We set probability cutoff for each model to distinguish predictions with low confidence.	7.0	1.0	65f410ad92c76639b816bef8	39172545			Guowei Chen, Jingzhe Jiang, and Yanni Sun	GigaScience	VirHost: a machine learning-based method for predicting reservoir hosts of RNA viruses through viral genomes	10.1093/gigascience/giae059	2024				1.0	2024-03-16T13:04:21.998Z	2024-03-16T13:04:21.998Z	e2ca04b9-38fe-40d6-9fd9-5c8355f4402d	undenfined	ta01kc1au8

Intel. 27, 1226–1238) were used, to evaluate the importance of each feature. Key features were then selected, and fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) with supervised classifiers to identify the optimal gene signatures for screening different TCs.   The IFS was run with SVM, RIPPER, and RF, respectively.   The optimal numbers of features turned out to be 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).

Class negative: putatively neutral insertion/deletion variants. Unclear but likely: 2,392.

Determination of exact number of training and test data points is difficult to ascertain due to poor alignment with numeric figures provided in the text to that of Table 2 which contains this information.

Neither sets of numbers align exactly to the text and no clear key/description provided. 

Dataset reuse/community recognised: data used is a subset of avilable data from reputable international databases. Large variety of databases leveraged and combined for training and test data."	"How were the sets split?: 
For the training data:
-Validation set (25%): A quarter of the training data is used to fine-tune the model during training (resilient propagation method).
-Cross-validation (10-fold): The training data is divided into 10 folds. The model is trained on 9 folds and tested on the remaining one, repeated 10 times, to assess generalisability (AUC-ROC).

Are the training and test sets independent?: 
Yes, indpendent test and training sets used.

How does the distribution compare to previously published ML datasets?:
MutPred-Indel is compared to three existing methods: DDIG-in, VEST-Indel, and CADD  but it uses the training data from the current study, not entirely independent datasets. The paper notes a 'paucity' of such data."	"Training data set comprised of:
-5606 single residue deletions
-1033 single residue insertions
-2427 multi-residue insertions

2x test data sets were used to test the models classification efficacy.
1. Somatic mutation test sets: consisting of two sets of putatively damaging cancer causing somatic variants derived from information in COSMIC AND dbCID databases. Text seems to indicate 576 test data points based on the final sentence '(n = 576)' but not clear or explictly stated/documented in text.

"Yes, the evaluation of MutPred-Indel included comparisons to both simpler baselines and publicly available methods.

Simpler baseline: authors compared MutPred-Indel to MutPred2. They achieved this by simulating deletions and insertions using MutPred2 and showed that MutPred-Indel outperformed MutPred2 in this scenario (AUC of 0.903 vs 0.797)

No further information avaialble regarding prediction run times beyond this.	Somewhat of a black box from the text alone. In the text there are reasonable descriptions of the model but given the lack of publicly available model & code (eg: in Huggingface/other model hosting/no GitHub) and exact training & test datasets. It is somewhat of a blackbox if attempting to reproduce and interpret the exacts of the model given its complex ML algorithm nature being that of an ensemble of neural networks from the text alone. However, there is a GitHub online that can be found for the model and related datasets so this helps greatly with the model interpretability in conjunction with the text. However, it should be explictly linked for readers. The Matlab related files and info also not available on GitHub due to licensing.	Classification - used to predict pathogenicity of indels	4.0	0.0	The ML algorithm used in the paper is an ensemble of bagged two-layer feed-forward neural networks.	No, not clearly available from the text or software website. Regarding parameters reporting, the text does note: 'Each pathogenicity predictor was developed with the Matlab 2016b Neural Network Toolbox as an ensemble of one hundred bagged two-layer feed-forward neural networks, where the following training parameters were not varied between alternative models'.	Preprocessing was undertaken via Two-sample t-test and principal component analysis (PCA). Encoding used and detailed under feature engineering section such as numerical encoding.	Precise number of input features not explicitly stated in main publication text. The structural and functional features of protein sequences are detailed in Table 3 of the text and fall into 5x categories with approximately 57 noted across these categories. 	Provided that the feature information and inferred parameter infromation (not easy to discern from text), the risk of overfitting is not very likely due to N >> p and the validation set. For underfitting this is mitigated by minimal feature reduction and 10-fold cross-validation employed, but this is dependent on significance of the features and risk grows if the features used are not significant enough. 	No	Without the precise feature count the number of parameters cannot be exactly determined. However, if to use the estimated number of features from Table 3 in the text (57 features from total of 5x categories), it could be inferred that with a network architecture of a two-layer feed-forward neural network with 10 hidden units would be 591.

Post-hoc analysis showed e.g. that the contribute of the Transient Elastography (TE) feature to the good predictability was very relevant, which is meaningful.  An explaination for an eventual joint effect of the 9 features was not adressed.	Classification.  Case A: positive and negative samples are non-significant fibrosis vs. significant fibrosis. Case B: positive and negative samples are non-cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis.			LightGBM (a gradient boosting framework using tree based learning algorithms) is stated in the Supplementary to have been the algorithm of choice.	No.	For character data field (like sex, pathogenesis), the LabelEncoder method in Python was used (categorical features encoded as a one-hot numeric array).	Starting from 24 features (clinical measurements commons to the 4 hospitals), 9 features were selected for training, by means of LASSO regression and filter methods (the latter being variance threshold, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, chi-square test and mutual information).	The LightGBM algorithm is stated in its documentation likely to be over-fitting if not used with the appropriate parameters. 	No.	The number of parameters was the standard for Python implementation of LightGBM.  Parameters were tuned to get good results by means of grid search, random search and the Python library Hyperopt.	"Yes.  The authors state that, ""to prevent overfitting, the index of colsample_bytree was set to 0.9"".    Other parameters tuning for over-fitting prevention is not mentioned.

	Yes. Supporting Information.	Proteomes of urine samples from 54 T2D (Type 2 Diabetes) patients from Pusan National University Hospital, South Korea.

Not applicable	SVM model with linear kernel was generated by a 10 fold repeated three-fold cross validation.  The RF model was generated by a 3-fold cross validation method repeated 100 times.			No.	The performances of the SVM and RF models were compared to the predicting performance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a simple biomarker for DKD which has been widely used so far.	The authors state that the AUROC of the two classifiers (SVM and RF) differed significantly from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (likelihood ratio test: p-value < 0.05). However, for the RF AUROC (value = 1.0) no confidence intervals are reported, and the confidence intervals for SVM AUROC are not further specified.	AUROC.  Comparison of disease prediction scores.	Cross-validation.   Since the authors were unable to find a benchmarking study in the discovery of urine protein biomarkers, they evaluated the models with mRNA expression in the kidney.   The SVM and RF models consisting of 5 urine proteins were applied to 4 publicly available GEO datasets:  GSE99339, GSE47185, GSE30122, and GSE96804.  However, the predictions on such datasets were not statistically significant.			Data were analyzed using the publicly available RStudio (version 1.1.456) including R (version 3.6.0). 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   The RF and SVM are generally considered black box.   Post-hoc analysis resulted somewhat interpretable, since the 5 selected features correspond to 5 urinary proteins that are considered likely to be related to DKD.  However, their eventual joint effect remains not interpretable.	Binary classification (PPG or GPG).  The binary results of RF and SVM models were also transformed in disease prediction scores, which ranged from 0 to 1.			SVM and RF.	No.	Not reported.	The study focused on 412 proteins (of the 1296 identified proteins in each proteome) quantified in more than 80% of urine samples, with missing values filled by local least squares imputation.  From those 412 proteins, 5 proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. 	The authors do not mention overfitting issues, although their multivariate AUROCs showed very high values.	No.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.

The trained imputer was tested by removing the data of one metabolite feature column and imputing the data afterward. The performance of the imputer was measured for each of the metabolites using R^2 metric. Metabolite columns with R^2 < 0.3 and more than 5% of missing values across all patients were removed. 3) Data standardization to zero mean and unit variance for each metabolite feature column.  Data pre-processing step reduced the feature columns to 75 metabolites.  	Metabolic profiles of 45 metabolites following data preprocessing. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV), using random forest, reduced the number of features to 15 metabolites.

	Yes. Supplementary Data.	ChIP-seq data, including uniformly processed peak calling results and peak width of promoter histone modifications from Roadmap and ENCODE projects for active (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H2A.Z) and repressive (H3K27me3) promoter modifications, and marks associated with enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, DNase I hypersensitivity sites).   Curated haploinsufficient (HIS) genes, positive (Npos) training observations, were collected from haploinsufficient training genes used in previous studies and genes with haploinsufficient score of 3 in ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map.  Curated haplosufficient (HS) genes, negative (Nneg) training observations, included genes deleted in two or more healthy people, based on CNVs detected in 2026 normal individuals.  All data were used in previous studies. 	Only genes with half or more of its length covered by any deletion were considered “deleted” (HS genes) in an individual.  The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed:   1) Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation. 2) From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011). 3) From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed. 	Following pruning for the training set, Npos=287 curated haploinsufficient genes and Nneg=574 curated haplosufficient genes were considered for further analysis. 1) Ntrain=90%. Ntest=10%. 10-fold cross validation for training. 100 randomized runs. 2) Final training with all training data and estimation of probabilities. 			Yes. Supplementary Data.	Random Forest model performed better than SVM and SVM with Lasso, and it was chosen for training the final model (Episcore). Comparison of Episcore with pLI scores from ExAC, Shet values, and ranks of mouse heart expression level, using de novo likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) variants identified in: 1)  A previously published whole exome sequencing study DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders consortium) of 1365 trio families with congenital heart disease (CHD). 2) A second CHD WES cohort of 2645 parent−offspring trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). LGD variants include frameshift, nonsense and canonical splice site mutations. Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing LGD de novo variants than the other methods. 	Permutation testing.	ROC curve, AUC score, sensitivity, specificity	1) 100 randomized runs with Ntrain=90% and Ntest=10% for each run. 10-fold cross validation was applied. 2) For the best performing model (Random Forest) all training data were used to train the final model. 			Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	Not specified	Epigenomic features critical for the prediction were determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient between each epigenomic feature and Episcore (random forest model) prediction.   One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type.  To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by: 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.  This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features. 	Binary predictions. All training genes used to train the best performing Random Forest model, and then estimate the probabilities of being positive (HIS) for all genes. The whole process was repeated 30 times and the arithmetic mean of the 30 sets of probabilities was used as result.			Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and SVM with LASSO feature selection.	Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	For promoter features (H2A.Z, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac), GappedPeaks were used to allow for broad domains of ChIP-seq signal. The assignment of a GapppedPeak to a gene followed these steps in order:  1) For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used. 2) A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed. 3) For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept. 4) For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept. After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.  Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and RNA-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized. 	The widths of called ChIP-seq peaks was used as promoter features. The counts of the interacting number of promoters and enhancers within pre-defined topologically associated domains (TADs) as enhancer features. Specifically, the results of peak width and number of interacting enhancers were consolidated into a matrix, with each row being a gene and each column representing a combination of a tissue and a data type, e.g. “H3K4me3 peak width in fetal heart”. One combination of a tissue and a data type was referred to as one epigenomic feature. This matrix was used as input for the machine learning models.

	Yes. Supporting information.	Training dataset of 40 pairs of Pdu protein sequences whose presence or absence of physical, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) could be experimentally validated via binding assays, complementation and expression studies or crystallographic data.  Testing dataset of protein orthologs collected from 34 bacterial genomes in the KEGG database and collapsed among 22 orthologous protein groups, which represent types of bacterial microcompartment (MCP) proteins known to be associated with the propanediol utilizing (Pdu) system. 	Incomplete or erroneous annotations of the Pdu gene products were corrected after sequence comparison with the Pdu operon from Salmonella enterica LT2, the best-characterized strain in terms of Pdu MCP.	For the training set, Npos=16 interacting and Nneg=24 non-interacting protein pairs.

For prediction probability is less than 0.7 then the result is neg, and for equal or greater than 0.7 the result is pos (increased specificity).			Random Forest classifier	Not available	For each ortholog group, its corresponding protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them.   Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal RNA to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices. 	For each protein pair, 7 coevolution features measuring the pairwise tree similarities have been defined.  Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL. The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).

There are 7x744 datapoints for training, yet this seems still limited given the complexity of the DL network to extract features. Not considering the DL, and only the SVM, things look better as the feature set is reduced to 62 features in total, so f > p.

Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel (Linear SVM)	No	The subjects’ brains were parcellated into 200 regions of interest (ROIs) using the Craddock atlas. Τhe RS-fMRI data were preprocessed to calculate FC measures between each pair of ROIs.  Friston-24 parameters were used to regress out the effects of head motion. To further reduce the effects of nuisance factors, signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were also regressed out.  DARTEL toolbox was used to normalize the data and the resulting images were finally smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The time series within each ROI were first band-pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz) and then averaged. For each participant, FC was calculated between each ROI using Pearson’s correlation coefficients, resulting in 19900-dimensional FC feature vectors for each subject. Patients with SCZ were labeled as 1, and HCs were labeled as -1. 	FC measurements between each pair of the 200 brain ROIs were used as classification features.

No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   The model looks to me black box.   Post-hoc interpretability for the ipeptidylprolyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene is supported e.g. by literature reports that this gene significant increases in differentiated carcinomas vs. normal or benign thyroid nodules at average 46 times.   However, the low univariate rankings of 2 of the 3 genes indicated that it was the genes combination, that resulted in good predictive power, and no attempt was made to explain such joint effect.	Binary classification between benign and malignant thyroid tumors.			Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) algorithm.	No.	Not reported.	f=3.   The feature selection method to distinguish benign from malignant samples consisted of two steps: a LIMMA linear model, and an iterative BMA algorithm.   The R package LIMMA was used  to  select  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes (fold-change cutoff of >=2 and a p-value<0.01). To minimize the number of signature genes, the iterative BMA R package was applied, which accounts for model uncertainty and the dependency between signature genes.    The BMA step was applied to further reduce the number of signature genes from 43 to 3, and thus the costs associated with microarrays and time-consuming data analysis.	 Over- or under- fit could probably be excluded a posteriori by the good predictive performance in independent test sets and novel experiments.

	No.	Total dataset composed of 535 in-field observations, N_pos = 84  (presence of spore-realising apothecia) and N_neg = 352 (absence of spore-realising apothecia).  Dataset not previously used.	Not applicable.	The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) using the “createDataPartition” function part of the caret package in R (version 3.2.4 for iOS).  Each model was trained with 10-fold cross-validation.    The random splitting of the data, model training, and assessment on the test set were performed 100 times to ascertain the variance of each model due to the random data splitting.			No.	Four approaches were compared: LR, MARS, ANN, RF.  Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa-metrics, and Brier score.  The best measures were those of RF.	Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa metrics, and Brier score. The AUROC of the RF model was highest at 0.74, significantly higher than LR (with a value of 0.57) but not significantly different from the ANN or MARS models.   LR had a very low kappa value (0.16), while RF had kappa values between 0.43 and 0.57, higher than ANN and MARS values of between 0.35 and 0.5 and, therefore, has the best prediction potential among the four models tested in this study based on the kappa metric.	Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUROC.	Cross-validation.			 Standard algorithms were used. 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   LR and MARS are generally considered interpretable models, while ANN and RF are generally considered not interpretable.    Post-hoc feature importance analysis indicated as the most important ones soil moisture, precipitation, and air temperature (LR model), or soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation (MARS, ANN, RF models) -- all of them in line with conclusions found in experimental literature.	Classification (binary prediction).  The continuous output of the LR, MARS, ANN was assigned as 'close to 1' or 'close to 0'.			Four approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF). 	No	Not reported.	Exploratory data analyses resulted in removal of correlated predictors (±0.90).   In the end, 7 predictors were used (i.e. 7 types of environmental data -- air temperature, relative humidity, etc).  The “varImp” function contained in the caret package was used to determine the relative predictor importance for each model. Each model was run using 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 predictors. The most important variables were selected for the development of the final model.	Over-fitting in MARS and ANN was discussed and prevented.   In LR and RF, over-fitting should not have been an issue.  Possible underfitting was probabiy there for LR, which, with a kappa of 0.16, indicated a low degree of similarity, between observed and predicted, beyond random chance.	No.	For LR, MARS, RF, the authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.   For ANN, weights can be deduced to have been in the range of 100. Their number depended on the number of nodes in the hidden layer, which was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUROC curve for model assessment.	For MARS, the forward stepwise algorithm leads to an overfitted model which is then run through a backward stepwise algorithm where basis functions that contribute the least are removed (Friedman1991).   For RF,  to reduce overfitting, the tree was often pruned, resulting in a smaller tree with fewer splits. This was accomplished using the Gini index, which is a measure of variance across all classes—smaller values mean a more accurate prediction at that node.			65faa4f792c76639b82bab29	28696170			Harteveld DOC, Grant MR, Pscheidt JW, Peever TL.

	Yes, Data are available from the Clinical Research Committee of KOBIO under the Korean College of Rheumatology for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data	This study used data from the KOBIO registry, which is a nationwide multicenter cohort in Korea that was established to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of biologic therapies in patients with RA [13]. Patients in the registry were recruited from 38 hospitals since 2012, and their demographics, medications, comorbidities, extra-articular manifestations, disease activities, radiographic findings, and laboratory findings performed within 4 weeks prior to the patient’s visit were recorded with the date. The data from patients who were followed up annually were recorded on the KOBIO website (http://www.kobio.or.kr/kobio/), and these patients provided informed consent prior to registration. Ethical approval of the KOBIO-RA was obtained from the institutional review boards of all 38 participating institutions, including the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital (PAIK 2018-11-005).		 the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set			no	The no information rate, which is the largest proportion of the observed classes, was used as a baseline to determine the overall distribution of the classification and to compare with those of the machine learning models	na	Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.

Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if “yes” and 0 if “no” or “no test” because “no” was the most common value.	To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.	no	a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters.

The MGH data set (N =2532) was partitioned into a healthy training set (N = 1343) used to train the model, and a testing set (N =1189) to evaluate model performance.  As validation, they used a subset of the SHHS data set where each participant underwent 2 study visits, referred as SHHS1 and SHHS2. The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set.			no.	no.

An example is provided in Figure 5 of the paper.	Regression.			Novel approach: They develop a machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets. The model is described in the paper.	yes, included in the paper.	EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts. For 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is 7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.	They extract 102 features from each 30-second epoch covering both time and frequency domains. For each EEG recording, they average the features in each of the 5 sleep stages overtime, yielding 102 x 5 = 510 features per EEG.	One strength of the study is the use of large data sets. The number of EEGs involved in this study is large among relevant “BA” studies. The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the model performs.	no.	one. To determine the optimal hyperparameter, they randomly select 300 EEGs from the training set to serve as internal validation data.				6312169df3794236aa987a03	30448611	PMC6478501		Sun H, Paixao L, Oliva JT, Goparaju B, Carvalho DZ, van Leeuwen KG, Akeju O, Thomas RJ, Cash SS, Bianchi MT, Westover MB.
