DOI_MATCH 	45		A Novel Dataset for Nuclei and Tissue Segmentation in Melanoma with baseline nuclei segmentation and tissue segmentation benchmarks	000	678fa69f5a9877fd97a7d5dc	The training dataset is available on zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10940194) with a CC-BY 4.0 licence. 	"The dataset consists of 155 primary and 155 metastatic melanoma manually selected ROIs, scanned at 40× magnification (0.22 µm/px) with a size of 1024 × 1024 pixels. For these ROIs, annotations of both tissue and nuclei are supplied, as well as a context ROI of 5120 × 5120 pixels centered around the ROI. Annotations were created by a medical expert and checked and corrected by a dermatopathologist.  All cases were digitized in a large melanoma referral center, however 76 cases are revisions or consultations originating from other treatment hospitals. Annotations are in the .GeoJSON format, making annotations easily visualizable with the opensource pathology image viewer Qupath. 

The following nuclei categories were used:  tumor, stroma, vascular endothelium, histiocyte, melanophage, lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, apoptotic and epithelium and the following tissue categories were used: tumor, stroma, epidermis, necrosis, blood vessel, and background. A total of 147 739 nuclei are manually annotated. "	The sets were split randomly. As each sample is a histological specimen from a different patient the training and test dataset are independent. 	"The PUMA dataset contains 103 primary melanoma ROIs and 103 metastatic melanoma ROIs in the training set, with a total of 97,429 nuclei. 
The test set includes 52 primary melanoma ROIs and 52 metastatic melanoma ROIs, comprising 50,490 nuclei. 

In the manuscript the distribution of metastatic sites, nuclei and tissue annotations is plotted in the data description paragraph. "	4.0	0.0	https://github.com/tueimage/PUMA-challenge-eval-track1, https://github.com/tueimage/PUMA-challenge-eval-track2	"Yes, a comparison with publicly available methods has been performed (NN192, Hover-Net and Hover-NeXt trained on the PanNuke dataset). 
No publicly available method exists able at segmenting skin tissue on H&E stained histopathology images. "	The results are bootstrapped for generation of confidence intervals. This is not performed in the final public evaluation code for the PUMA challenge due to reducing computational burden. The difference in performance between the used models is statistically significant. 	"For the calculation of the F1 score, the center distance between the predicted nuclei and the ground truth nuclei was used. For each ground truth nucleus, predictions within a 15 pixel (3.3 μm) were identified. This radius is smaller than the average size of lymphocytes, which form the smallest nuclei in the dataset. Matching was performed based on the highest predictive score (if available) or the shortest distance. After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40]. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is calculated through bootstrapping the samples. 

Both models and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated using the DICE score. The DICE score is a harmonic mean between 0 and 1, in which 1 is a perfect segmentation prediction, and 0 is no correct prediction. This can result in inflated high average DICE scores if a tissue class is only present in a few samples, as the DICE score is 1 in the case of a correct absent prediction. To accommodate this, we calculated not only the average DICE score over all samples but also the micro average DICE. This is the DICE score for all predictions concatenated along one axis, resulting in a prediction mask of 1024 × 96.256 pixels. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is generated through bootstrapping the sample results. 

Metrics are in line with literature (Maier-Hein, L., Reinke, A., Godau, P. et al. Metrics reloaded: recommendations for image analysis validation.

Segmentation	4.0	0.0	"In this study, two algorithm classes are used. The first class consists of models for nuclei instance segmentation, while the second class includes semantic segmentation models for medical image analysis. The nuclei instance segmentation algorithms offer advantages over classic models due to post-processing techniques like watershed segmentation, which help separate densely packed nuclei. Additionally, these algorithms can be applied to whole slide images instead of tiles. 

For tissue annotation semantic segmentation, two models were used. The first is nnU-Net, which is designed for supervised medical image segmentation. The second is Mask2Former2, a transformer segmentation algorithm which can be used for supervised semantic segmentation. For this experiment the backbone was replaced by a foundation model that is better able at feature extraction from histopathology images.


"	The original training code of the models used was not adjusted. Weights for the baseline solution of the PUMA challenge are supplied on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13881999). 	Annotations are supplied in the .geoJSON format. For training of Hover-Net and Hover-Next the .geoJSON and .TIFF images were recoded to numpy array masks. For tissue segmentation the .geoJSON were encoded to .PNG masks. 	No explicit feature selection was performed. The models used the raw input from the images without reducing or selecting specific features. Therefore, the entire dataset, including both tissue and nuclei information, was used for training without separate feature selection steps.	In this study, due to the use of different models, it’s hard to directly compare p (parameters) and f (input features) with the number of training points. The models were used to establish a baseline without detailed tuning. Overfitting was countered by 5-fold cross-validation and the use of an independent test set, though specific model-related techniques were not addressed.	No	The models in this research used default configurations for the number of parameters. The goal was to establish a baseline for the dataset, providing a reference point for the PUMA challenge. The community is then invited to improve upon these baseline models in future work. No manual tuning or selection of the number of parameters (p) was performed.	To decrease the risk of overfitting we used data-augmentation and 5-fold cross validation to define a training and validation set in the original training set. We took the mean of these models on the independent test set. 	7.0	1.0	678fa631edf7b65039c6cf91	-			Mark Schuiveling, Hong Liu, Daniel Eek,  Gerben E. Breimer,  Karijn P.M. Suijkerbuijk, Willeke A.M.

The data was taken from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes - Viruses (IMGVR) databases. The corresponding GigaScience database contains the original data, including accession IDs	To ensure the independence of the training and test sets, we first delete duplicates in the dataset. Then, we use BLAST to remove strongly homologous sequences and create different test subsets to evaluate our models	The exact training/test splits are recorded and are part of the GigaScience database. Originally, the test data comprised 20% of the total data (565,760 original sequences) and was later downsampled for different homology conditions. To ensure a fair comparison, we created multiple test sets using different sequence homologies and report the performance on each one of them. Additionally, we use a nested 5-fold cross-validation (CV) to properly assess the quality of our optimization in the HVSeeker-protein setting (98,720 phage sequences and 122,366 bacteria sequences). Hence, during optimization, HVSeeker-protein uses another 20% of the data for validation. The different data splits used for optimization are also part of the GigaScience database.	4.0	0.0	All evaluation files, including previous test-splits and models used to achieve the performance are supplied as part of the gigascience dataset. 	We compare our method against other SOTA methods (Seeker, Rnn-VirSeeker, DeepVirFinder, PPR-Meta ) and an additional HMM baseline. The scripts used for this evaluation are part of the gigascience database. 	HVSeeker is shown to outperform other methods on various comprehensive datasets and on different performance metrics. 	We use precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score, ROC-AUC  to fairly compare different methods. 	For optimization runs we used a nested 5-fold CV, ensuring fair assessment of our results due to independent test datasets. When testing HVSeeker-DNA we additionally used subsets of our original independent test-set of different homology conditions to challenge our models. In the last step we test HVSeeker against a novel dataset based on the infant gut metagenome, showing it's utility in a practical setting.	5.0	0.0	The source code is released on github and can be found in the gigascience database aswell (MIT license included). To make it easier to run the scripts, we also supply a conda environment with instructions for easy installation. 	Executing a simple forward pass with one sequence only takes around 0.0366 seconds on a standard machine (cpu only). Prediction time is therfore neglegtible. 	As it is the case with most deep-learning methods, interpretaing the classification results is unfortunately not directly possible. 	The model performs classification. 	4.0	0.0	HVSeeker is based on established machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as LSTM and Transformer, which are known to work well with sequences and have been adapted to our specific problem	The model files, optimization schedule and paramter and hyperparameter configurations are reported and can be found in the gigascience database. 	HVSeeker relies on one-hot encoding but merges data in different ways, such as padding (cycling through the sequence until it reaches the required length), contig assembly (combining multiple shorter sequences to generate a longer sequence, then splitting it into subsequences of 1000 bp), and sliding window (using a window of 1000 bp to slide over the input DNA sequence in 100 bp steps)	Both versions of HVSeeker rely only on the sequence, the input features are therfore the nucleotides/amino acids of the input sequence. No further feature selection was performed.	We evaluate our models during training using a validation set to achieve an optimal fit of the paramters.	HVSeeker-Protein uses input from a pre-trained version of ProtBert. Since ProtBert was previously trained on a masked language task, it had not encountered a classification task prior to this study.	HVSeeker contains 1026152 trainable parameter. The number of parameter is a result of adapting the model to the training process. 	We use early stopping using a validation set and dropout to prevent overfitting to the training data.

The source of the dataset is INfrastructure for a PHAge REference Database (INPHARED) provided by https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared on Aug 1st, 2022. There are 3,659 bacteriophage genomes in this dataset. We curated 1912 tailspike protein sequences and 200732 non-tailspike protein sequences from this dataset. This data has not been used in previous papers.	To train and validate the SpikeHunter the manually curated set of tailspike proteins was first clustered into 20,274 clusters at 30% identity using CD-HIT.

TITLE_MATCH DOI_MATCH 	30	3/27/2022 23:10:49	MRI-based machine learning radiomics can predict HER2 expression level and pathologic response after neoadjuvant therapy in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer.	10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.103042		Not available	Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data from 311 HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.  1)        Patients were classified into two groups based on HER2 expression level. Npos=279 patients with tumours that showed HER2 protein overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+; IHC group). Nneg=32 patients with tumours that showed HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH in the absence of protein overexpression on IHC (IHC 2+ or 1+ to 2+; FISH group). 2)        Npos=188 patients with pathologic complete response (pCR), which was defined as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/isN0) at surgical resection. Nneg=123 patients that are non-pCR. 	Inclusion criteria for this study were HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients who underwent NAC and pretreatment state-of-the-art contrast-enhanced breast MRI. 70 were excluded because they did not have pretreatment breast MRI and 64 patients with outside images were excluded because of poor image quality.	For the prediction of pathological complete response, the data was split into training and test sets at a ratio of 4:1 (80% training and 20% test), with feature selection performed purely on the training set. Npos,train=150 patients with pCR. Npos,test=38 patients with pCR. Nneg,train=99 patients with non-pCR. Nneg,test=24 patients with non-pCR.  Due to the low number of cases in the minority class, this was not feasible for the comparison between the IHC and FISH groups.

Assessing the presence of statistically significant differences, using Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-squared test, across clinical and MRI features of 1) IHC vs FISH and 2) pCR vs non-pCR groups, before including them to the final model.	1) Binary predictions of IHC (positive) or FISH (negative) samples. 2) Binary predictions of pCR (positive) or non-pCR (negative) samples. 			Coarse decision trees	Not available	Following ROC and correlation analysis, Breast MRIs were assessed according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon.  Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-SNAP software.  Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours.   Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.  Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.  Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.  Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed. 	1) The final model to predict HER2 intratumour expression levels (IHC vs. FISH) utilized three MRI features. Lesion type and multifocality (clinical features) and large zone emphasis (radiomic feature). 2) The model to predict pCR status included six MRI parameters. Lesion type and size (clinical parameters) and variance, first order entropy, 90th percentile and zone length variance (radiomic parameters). 	Not specified	No	Coarse decision tree modelling was implemented in MATLAB, with the maximum number of splits set at four and utilizing Gini’s diversity index as the splitting criterion.

TITLE_MATCH 	45		PlasGO: enhancing GO-based function prediction for plasmid-encoded proteins based on genetic structure	10.1093/gigascience/giae104	67333632a96b586fdb27231e	You can access to the curated RefSeq dataset with the link http://zenodo.org/records/14005015 (dataset.tar.gz), which is licensed under the CC0 license.	The data is all curated from the NCBI RefSeq database. There are 173,666, 99,945, 28,081 data points for the three GO categories, MF, BP, and CC, repectively (three sub-tasks). The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.	As described above, the generated test set can serve as a novel protein set compared to the training set. Specficially, the minimum normalized edit distances between the training set and the test set for most of the labels are larger than 0.7 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 in the manuscript).	There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO. Because of the large number of the binary classifications (377), we can't plot all the distributions. However, the data type distributions are roughly consistent for the training, validation, and test sets.	4.0	0.0	Yes, you can check the dataset used for benchmark experiments via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records /14005015.	Because the RefSeq test set we curated is to simulate the novel protein function prediction scenario, we didn't include any alignment-based tools for benchmarking, such as Diamond and BLASTP. Additionally, we conducted the benchmarking experiments with six learning-based state-of-the-art tools, including DeepGOPlus, PFresGO, TALE, DeepSeq, TM-Vec, and CaLM. For a fair comparison, we retrained all of them using our curated RefSeq dataset (training/validation/test). The results showed that PlasGO performed the best on all three GO categories (Figure 6 in the manuscript).	No. The two evaluation metrics do not relate to confidence intervals. For more details, please refer to the CAFA challanges.	"We used the two commonly used metrics in the CAFA challenge, namely the protein-centric Fmax and the term-centric AUPR. For more details of the two metrics, please refer to the ""Experimental setup"" section in the manuscript."	We conducted a series of rigorous experiments to evaluate the performance of PlasGO. All of them can be checked in the manuscript's Results part. Specifically, they include 1) the performance on the novel RefSeq test set, 2) two ablation studies for validating PlasGO’s design rationale, 3) visualization of the PlasGO embeddings for interpreting the BERT module, 4) identification of elusive GO term labels to improve the precision of PlasGO, 5) labels of different frequencies and confidence scores which show the performance stability on different labels and the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores, 6) application: automatic GO prediction for unannotated plasmid-encoded proteins in RefSeq, which pre-annotates high-confidence GO terms for all available plasmid proteins (678,197), 7) case study: annotations for two well-studied conjugative plasmids associated with AMR.	5.0	0.0	Yes. You can refer to the GitHub repository https://github.com/Orin-beep/PlasGO for most recent updates. Licensed under the MIT license.	The running speed of PlasGO is very fast. For the 365 plasmid proteins in the example data, it only took 1m48s for the GO term prediction on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. 	The model is interpretable. We mainly interpreted the global BERT module of PlasGO by comparing the raw embeddings generated from the ProtTrans model and the contextualized embeddings from the global BERT module. You can check the results from Figure 7 in the manuscript. The results showed thats suggests that PlasGO effectively captures the latent features associated with plasmid-specific functions.	Classification.	4.0	0.0	We employed deep learning in our tool. PlasGO consists of three sub-modules, a pre-trained protein language model, a global BERT model, and a classifier module incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The core part of PlasGO is the BERT model to learn the global context within plasmid sentences. We used the BERT model because we formuated plasmids as a language defined on the protein token set, and BERT is one of the state-of-the-art language models.	Yes, you can check PlasGO's default models (models.tar.gz) via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records/14005015, which is licensed under the CC0 license.	We employed the powerful foundation protein languange model, ProtTrans, to encode our input protein sequences. It can generate biologically meaningful embedding for each plasmid-encoded protein. Then, the raw input embeddings can greatly improve the performance of GO term prediction through transfer learning. 	"As described in V.3, the only input is the plasmid protein amino acid (AA) sequences. Then, ProtTrans is employed to generate the raw embeddings for each protein (preprocessing). By capturing the
semantic meaning of individual AA tokens and their contextual relationships within the protein sequence, ProtTrans will generate per-protein embeddings (1024 dimensions) as the input to the subsequent BERT module."	We have 89,835 plasmid sentences in total for training the simplified global BERT model with token classification task. As shown above, the simplest BERT model (CC) have hyperparameter of hidden_size=512, head_num=8, and layer_num=2. The corpus size (89,835) is sufficient to fit the BERT module. In addition, there are several overfitting strategies in the PlasGO models, which will be listed in V.7.	No. There is no data from other ML algorithms as input to PlasGO.	The parameter number is 13340504 for MF model, 13698908 for BP model, and 6891070 for CC model. Actually, the three models are all simple BERT models with hidden_size = 512, head_num = 8. Besides, we used 4 Transformer layers for MF and BP, and 2 Transformer layers for CC, considering the relatively smaller dataset size and label size for CC.	Yes. 1) Dropout layers adopted on both the classifier FC layer and also the attention blocks in the BERT model. 2) Validation set is employed to prevent overfitting. 3) Layer Normalization is employed for each Transformer block and also the token embedding layer. 4) A rank regularization method is utilized in the classifier module to promote the ability of the model to distinguish low-confidence and high-confidence predictions.

This comparison included structure-based methods such as SPPIDER, GraphPPIS, MaSIF-site, and ScanNet, as well as sequence-based methods like TargetDNA, hybridRNAbind, DeepDISOBind, and DRNApred. The performance was evaluated using various metrics, including Recall, Precision, F1-Score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, AUC, and AUPRC.

Additionally, the paper mentioned comparisons with simpler baseline models, such as sequence-based methods that use only sequence information and structure-based methods that rely solely on the 3D structure of proteins. Through these comparisons, the GraphRBF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting protein binding sites.On the protein-protein binding test set, the AUC, PRC, F1-score, and MCC of GraphRBF are 0.028, 0.108, 0.055, and 0.066 higher than the second highest value, with relative improvements achieving 3.5%, 41.9%, 16.2%, and 24% respectively.

"	We did not set confidence intervals but instead directly compared the various metrics of our model with other models (using the same computational methods), and obtained the best results, which sufficiently demonstrates the superiority of our model.	"A variety of performance metrics are reported to evaluate the GraphRBF model, including:
Recall
Precision
F1-Score
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)
Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)
These metrics are standard in the fields of bioinformatics and machine learning and provide a comprehensive assessment of the predictive performance of the model. Recall and precision measure the model's ability to identify positive and negative instances, the F1-Score is the harmonic mean of these two metrics, MCC provides a correlation measure between -1 and 1, and AUC and AUPRC offer an overall measure of the model's performance, especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Regarding the representativeness of this set of performance metrics, they are consistent with those used in the literature for similar tasks and can be considered representative. These metrics allow researchers to make comparisons with existing methods and demonstrate the performance of the GraphRBF model in predicting protein binding sites."	GraphRBF method was evaluated using an independent test dataset. This approach involved training and testing the model on datasets for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interaction sites separately, and comparing it with other leading prediction methods. A variety of evaluation metrics were used in the assessment, such as Recall, Precision, F1-Score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Moreover, the GraphRBF model was applied to a novel protein structure, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, and the predictions were analyzed and visualized, offering additional validation of the method.	5.0	0.0	Source codes are in https://github.com/Wssduer/GraphRBF. We also have a web server http://www.liulab.top/GraphRBF.	Prediction time is about 3-5 minutes for small proteins and 10-30 minutes for very huge proteins. For training, the model needs 0.5-1 hour for one epoch.	GraphRBF model is interpretable rather than a black box. It provides not only predictive results but also insights into its learned representations and decision-making processes.	The GraphRBF model is a classification model. It is designed to classify whether each residue in a protein is a binding site or not, which is a categorical outcome—a fundamental aspect of classification tasks. The model uses learned features from protein structures to make these classifications, predicting the likelihood of a residue being part of a binding site, which is then typically binary or multiclass labeled (e.g., binding site or non-binding site).	4.0	0.0	"The ML algorithm class used is Deep Learning and supervised learning, specifically an interpretable hierarchical geometric deep learning model known as GraphRBF. This is a novel algorithm because it integrates both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs), with an enhanced graph neural network designed to describe physicochemical information interactions between amino acid residues and the introduction of a prioritized radial basis function to characterize the spatial distribution of residues.

The novel algorithm was chosen over better-known alternatives because it can more comprehensively represent the binding patterns of protein residues, including their spatial distribution and physicochemical information interactions, which could not be achieved by previous methods. GraphRBF offers enhanced interpretability and has demonstrated superior performance in predicting protein binding sites compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

But the data splits were our  random sets. And the protein datasets we established are inhttps://github.com/Wssduer/GraphRBF	"The protein-protein interaction datasets were obtained from Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark 5.5 (DBD 5.5)[1] and Dockground[2] database. These datasets consist of non-redundant, high-resolution structures, including both bound and unbound structures for each protein complex. Considering that protein conformation tends to change to varying degrees when interacting with other molecules in the cell, it makes more sense to use the unbound structures prior to the interaction to train and test the model. Finally, we obtained 1,251 protein-binding proteins as a dataset.
Then we constructed a baseline dataset of nucleic acid binding proteins from the BioLiP2[3] database, which collects biologically relevant ligand-protein interactions that are structurally resolved in complexes. DNA/RNA-binding proteins were collected from the dataset as of October 7, 2023, and contain a total of 42,457 DNA-protein complex entries and 146,306 RNA-protein complex entries. First, we selected high-resolution structures with a resolution of less than 8.0 Å. The resolution can reflect the accuracy of protein structure analysis; higher resolution indicates finer protein structure, while lower resolution indicates that the atomic structure in the crystal is more difficult to be clearly resolved and localized. Next, sequence similarity clustering was performed on the redundant data using psi-cd-hit, and the structures with the highest resolution were selected as representative entries for each cluster. Finally, we kept 1,871 RNA-binding proteins and 1,101 DNA-binding proteins.

The model uses learned features from protein structures to make these classifications, predicting the likelihood of a residue being part of a binding site, which is then typically binary or multiclass labeled (e.g., binding site or non-binding site).	4.0	0.0	"The ML algorithm class used is Deep Learning and supervised learning, specifically an interpretable hierarchical geometric deep learning model known as GraphRBF. This is a novel algorithm because it integrates both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs), with an enhanced graph neural network designed to describe physicochemical information interactions between amino acid residues and the introduction of a prioritized radial basis function to characterize the spatial distribution of residues.

The novel algorithm was chosen over better-known alternatives because it can more comprehensively represent the binding patterns of protein residues, including their spatial distribution and physicochemical information interactions, which could not be achieved by previous methods. GraphRBF offers enhanced interpretability and has demonstrated superior performance in predicting protein binding sites compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."	We reported these information in our paper(under review) and https://github.com/Wssduer/GraphRBF.	The node features are extracted based on the protein sequence and structure for each amino acid, while the residue coordinates are defined by the 3D coordinates of its α-carbon. Towards learning the binding patterns of a residue from its local neighborhood, we first extract its spatial neighbors and construct a local coordinate system that ensures rotation and translation invariance and then we build a local graph with nodes representing residues and edges denoting their close distances.	Multiple types of amino acid features are extracted that include atomic features of residues, secondary structure encoding, evolutionary information, and residue type encoding. Seven atomic features are extracted for each heavy atom belonging to the target residue based on the PDB file: atom mass, B-factor, whether it is a residue side-chain atom, electronic charge, the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to it, whether it is in a ring, and the van der Waals radius of the atom. The DSSP tool is applied to generate secondary structure features of residues including a residue water-exposed surface, five bond and torsion angles, and eight one-hot encoded secondary structure with eight states. For the evolutionary information, PSI-BLAST is used to search the Uniref 90 database for homologous sequences with three iterations and e-value<10^−3 to generate the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) with 20 dimensions. HHblits is implemented to search the uniclust30 database to generate an HMM matrix of the query sequence with 30 dimensions. For the residue type encoding, the 20 types of amino acids are ordered as ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY, and an 20-dimension one-hot coding of each residue is generated accordingly. In conclusion, a node feature matrix of size L×91 is constructed for each protein, in which L is the length of the protein. In addition, the original features are min-max normalized before training.	p is much larger. We uesd a smaller number of hidden later parameters(128) and network layers(1 or 2), as well as using dropout regularization, are effective methods to prevent overfitting.	The data and features are selected by ourselves from the public datasets and not from other algorithms.	"We conduct hyperparameter tuning experiments for GraphRBF and select the best hyperparameters on the validation set. 
Here are the hyperparameters:
Radius of the structural neighborhood: it defines the point cloud within the neighborhood of the target residue, and its unit is Å.(20)
The distance threshold to get the adjacency matrix: it defines the threshold for concatenating edges between residues, and its unit is Å.(10)
The number of GDG kernels in each filter.(32)
The number of filters used in PRBFNN.(64)
The number of representation layer. Layer 0 stands for the encoder layer.(1 for protein-DNA/RNA and 2 for protein-protein)
The dimension  of encoded position information vector using local coordinates.(64)
The dimension of encoded node, edge and graph feature vector. (128)
Learning rate for training the deep model.(0.0001)
Batch size for training deep model.(256)
