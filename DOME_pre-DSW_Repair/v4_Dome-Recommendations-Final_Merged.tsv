All subjects (Npos) are of European ancestry and Caucasian ethnicity. Data were collected from previous studies: Autism Genome Project (AGP), SAGE (Study of Addiction Genetics and Environment), Ontario Colorectal Cancer study, HABC (Health Aging and Body Composition). 	Only subjects harboring at least one rare genic CNV were used for classification, as features would be constantly zero for the other subjects, but all subjects were considered when reporting percentage “explained” statistics.

Jorda J, Liu Y, Bobik TA, Yeates TO.	PLOS Computational Biology	2015	2015	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004067		Training dataset of 40 pairs of Pdu protein sequences whose presence or absence of physical, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) could be experimentally validated via binding assays, complementation and expression studies or crystallographic data.  Testing dataset of protein orthologs collected from 34 bacterial genomes in the KEGG database and collapsed among 22 orthologous protein groups, which represent types of bacterial microcompartment (MCP) proteins known to be associated with the propanediol utilizing (Pdu) system. 	For the training set, Npos=16 interacting and Nneg=24 non-interacting protein pairs. For the testing set, pairwise combinations of the 22 orthologous protein groups resulted in 231 unique protein pairs that needed to be classified. 	Incomplete or erroneous annotations of the Pdu gene products were corrected after sequence comparison with the Pdu operon from Salmonella enterica LT2, the best-characterized strain in terms of Pdu MCP.	Yes. Supporting information.	Random Forest classifier	No	For each ortholog group, its corresponding protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them.   Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal RNA to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices. 	Not specified	For each protein pair, 7 coevolution features measuring the pairwise tree similarities have been defined.  Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL. The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB). 	Not specified	Not specified		Not explicitly interpreted.

Curated haploinsufficient (HIS) genes, positive (Npos) training observations, were collected from haploinsufficient training genes used in previous studies and genes with haploinsufficient score of 3 in ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map.  Curated haplosufficient (HS) genes, negative (Nneg) training observations, included genes deleted in two or more healthy people, based on CNVs detected in 2026 normal individuals.  All data were used in previous studies. 	Following pruning for the training set, Npos=287 curated haploinsufficient genes and Nneg=574 curated haplosufficient genes were considered for further analysis. 1) Ntrain=90%. Ntest=10%. 10-fold cross validation for training. 100 randomized runs. 2) Final training with all training data and estimation of probabilities. 	Only genes with half or more of its length covered by any deletion were considered “deleted” (HS genes) in an individual.  The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed:   1) Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation. 2) From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011). 3) From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed. 	Yes. Supplementary Data.	Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and SVM with LASSO feature selection.	No	For promoter features (H2A.Z, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac), GappedPeaks were used to allow for broad domains of ChIP-seq signal. The assignment of a GapppedPeak to a gene followed these steps in order:  1) For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used. 2) A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed. 3) For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept. 4) For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept. After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.  Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and RNA-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized. 	Alpha parameter equal to 1 for Lasso regularization. No further parameters were specified.	The widths of called ChIP-seq peaks was used as promoter features. The counts of the interacting number of promoters and enhancers within pre-defined topologically associated domains (TADs) as enhancer features. Specifically, the results of peak width and number of interacting enhancers were consolidated into a matrix, with each row being a gene and each column representing a combination of a tissue and a data type, e.g. “H3K4me3 peak width in fetal heart”. One combination of a tissue and a data type was referred to as one epigenomic feature. This matrix was used as input for the machine learning models. 	Not specified	Yes. LASSO regularization was used with SVM for overfitting prevention.		Epigenomic features critical for the prediction were determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient between each epigenomic feature and Episcore (random forest model) prediction.   One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type.  To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by: 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.  This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features. 	Binary predictions. All training genes used to train the best performing Random Forest model, and then estimate the probabilities of being positive (HIS) for all genes. The whole process was repeated 30 times and the arithmetic mean of the 30 sets of probabilities was used as result.		Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	1) 100 randomized runs with Ntrain=90% and Ntest=10% for each run. 10-fold cross validation was applied. 2) For the best performing model (Random Forest) all training data were used to train the final model. 		Random Forest model performed better than SVM and SVM with Lasso, and it was chosen for training the final model (Episcore). Comparison of Episcore with pLI scores from ExAC, Shet values, and ranks of mouse heart expression level, using de novo likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) variants identified in: 1)  A previously published whole exome sequencing study DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders consortium) of 1365 trio families with congenital heart disease (CHD). 2) A second CHD WES cohort of 2645 parent−offspring trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC).

Bitencourt AGV, Gibbs P, Rossi Saccarelli C, Daimiel I, Lo Gullo R, Fox MJ, Thakur S, Pinker K, Morris EA, Morrow M, Jochelson MS.	EBioMedicine	2020	2020	10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.103042		Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data from 311 HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients.  1)        Patients were classified into two groups based on HER2 expression level. Npos=279 patients with tumours that showed HER2 protein overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC 3+; IHC group). Nneg=32 patients with tumours that showed HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH in the absence of protein overexpression on IHC (IHC 2+ or 1+ to 2+; FISH group). 2)        Npos=188 patients with pathologic complete response (pCR), which was defined as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/isN0) at surgical resection. Nneg=123 patients that are non-pCR. 	For the prediction of pathological complete response, the data was split into training and test sets at a ratio of 4:1 (80% training and 20% test), with feature selection performed purely on the training set. Npos,train=150 patients with pCR. Npos,test=38 patients with pCR. Nneg,train=99 patients with non-pCR. Nneg,test=24 patients with non-pCR.  Due to the low number of cases in the minority class, this was not feasible for the comparison between the IHC and FISH groups.	Inclusion criteria for this study were HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients who underwent NAC and pretreatment state-of-the-art contrast-enhanced breast MRI. 70 were excluded because they did not have pretreatment breast MRI and 64 patients with outside images were excluded because of poor image quality.	Not available	Coarse decision trees	No	Following ROC and correlation analysis, Breast MRIs were assessed according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon.  Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-SNAP software.  Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours.   Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.  Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.  Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.  Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed. 	Coarse decision tree modelling was implemented in MATLAB, with the maximum number of splits set at four and utilizing Gini’s diversity index as the splitting criterion.	1) The final model to predict HER2 intratumour expression levels (IHC vs. FISH) utilized three MRI features. Lesion type and multifocality (clinical features) and large zone emphasis (radiomic feature). 2) The model to predict pCR status included six MRI parameters. Lesion type and size (clinical parameters) and variance, first order entropy, 90th percentile and zone length variance (radiomic parameters). 	Not specified	Not specified		Transparent.

Random forest	No	1) 16S rRNA raw amplicon sequencing data were processed and converted to sub-operational taxonomic unit (sOTU) abundance per sample (BIOM format) using the Deblur workflow. Taxonomies for sOTUs were assigned using the sklearn-based taxonomy classifier trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs in QIIME 2. The sOTU table was rarefied to a depth of 2,000 sequences/sample to control for sequencing effort. A phylogeny was inferred using SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement, which was used to insert 16S Deblur sOTUs into Greengenes 13_8 at a 99% phylogeny. 2) Raw LC-MS/MS data sets were converted to m/z extensible markup language (mzXML) in centroid mode using MSConvert. All mzXML files were cropped with an m/z range of 75.00 to 1,000.00 Da. Feature extraction was performed in MZmine2 with a signal intensity threshold of 2.0e5 and minimum peak width of 0.3 s. The maximum allowed mass and retention time tolerances were 10 ppm and 10 s, respectively. A local minimum search algorithm with a minimum relative peak height of 1% was used for chromatographic deconvolution; the maximum peak width was set to 1 min. The detected peaks were aligned across all samples using the above-mentioned retention time and mass tolerances, producing the final feature table used in these analyses.

Sun H, Paixao L, Oliva JT, Goparaju B, Carvalho DZ, van Leeuwen KG, Akeju O, Thomas RJ, Cash SS, Bianchi MT, Westover MB.	Neurobiology of Aging	2019	2019	10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.10.016		2 large sleep EEG data sets: the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sleep lab data set (N = 2532; ages 18-80); and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS, N =1974; ages 40-80)	The MGH data set (N =2532) was partitioned into a healthy training set (N = 1343) used to train the model, and a testing set (N =1189) to evaluate model performance.  As validation, they used a subset of the SHHS data set where each participant underwent 2 study visits, referred as SHHS1 and SHHS2. The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set.	They maintain strict separation of training and testing participants.	no.	Novel approach: They develop a machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets. The model is described in the paper.	no.	EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts. For 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is 7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.	one. To determine the optimal hyperparameter, they randomly select 300 EEGs from the training set to serve as internal validation data.	They extract 102 features from each 30-second epoch covering both time and frequency domains. For each EEG recording, they average the features in each of the 5 sleep stages overtime, yielding 102 x 5 = 510 features per EEG.	One strength of the study is the use of large data sets. The number of EEGs involved in this study is large among relevant “BA” studies. The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the model performs.			Transparent. The use of a parametric model, improves model interpretation by inspecting each EEG feature and comparing to the age norm for each feature explicitly. An example is provided in Figure 5 of the paper.

N_pos = 19 (poor prognosis group (PPG) due to DKD (Diabetic Kidney Disease), N_neg = 35 (good prognosis group (GPG), i.e. no DKD).   Not used in previous papers.	SVM model with linear kernel was generated by a 10 fold repeated three-fold cross validation.  The RF model was generated by a 3-fold cross validation method repeated 100 times.	Not applicable	Yes. Supporting Information.	SVM and RF.	No.	Not reported.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.  They mention the value of some parameters, without mentioning how they were chosen. 	The study focused on 412 proteins (of the 1296 identified proteins in each proteome) quantified in more than 80% of urine samples, with missing values filled by local least squares imputation.  From those 412 proteins, 5 proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. 	The authors do not mention overfitting issues, although their multivariate AUROCs showed very high values.	Not reported.		No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   The RF and SVM are generally considered black box.   Post-hoc analysis resulted somewhat interpretable, since the 5 selected features correspond to 5 urinary proteins that are considered likely to be related to DKD.  However, their eventual joint effect remains not interpretable.	Binary classification (PPG or GPG).  The binary results of RF and SVM models were also transformed in disease prediction scores, which ranged from 0 to 1.		Data were analyzed using the publicly available RStudio (version 1.1.456) including R (version 3.6.0). 	Cross-validation.   Since the authors were unable to find a benchmarking study in the discovery of urine protein biomarkers, they evaluated the models with mRNA expression in the kidney.   The SVM and RF models consisting of 5 urine proteins were applied to 4 publicly available GEO datasets:  GSE99339, GSE47185, GSE30122, and GSE96804.  However, the predictions on such datasets were not statistically significant.		The performances of the SVM and RF models were compared to the predicting performance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a simple biomarker for DKD which has been widely used so far.	The authors state that the AUROC of the two classifiers (SVM and RF) differed significantly from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (likelihood ratio test: p-value < 0.05). However, for the RF AUROC (value = 1.0) no confidence intervals are reported, and the confidence intervals for SVM AUROC are not further specified.	No.	No.	Not reported.	AUROC.

Not applicable.	According to the author's statement, the data are not available because of patients’ privacy.	LightGBM (a gradient boosting framework using tree based learning algorithms) is stated in the Supplementary to have been the algorithm of choice.	No.	For character data field (like sex, pathogenesis), the LabelEncoder method in Python was used (categorical features encoded as a one-hot numeric array).	The number of parameters was the standard for Python implementation of LightGBM.  Parameters were tuned to get good results by means of grid search, random search and the Python library Hyperopt.	Starting from 24 features (clinical measurements commons to the 4 hospitals), 9 features were selected for training, by means of LASSO regression and filter methods (the latter being variance threshold, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, chi-square test and mutual information).	The LightGBM algorithm is stated in its documentation likely to be over-fitting if not used with the appropriate parameters. 	"Yes.  The authors state that, ""to prevent overfitting, the index of colsample_bytree was set to 0.9"".    Other parameters tuning for over-fitting prevention is not mentioned. "		No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   This LightGBM model looks to me complex enough to result rather black box.   Post-hoc analysis showed e.g. that the contribute of the Transient Elastography (TE) feature to the good predictability was very relevant, which is meaningful.  An explaination for an eventual joint effect of the 9 features was not adressed.	Classification.  Case A: positive and negative samples are non-significant fibrosis vs. significant fibrosis. Case B: positive and negative samples are non-cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis.		The ML algorithms were implemented using Python 3.7.	5-fold cross-validation during training-testing.  Two independent datasets were used as evaluation sets:  the Anhui cohort (n = 408), and the Beijing cohort (n=332).		FibroBox was compared to 3 other pre-existing predicting methods: TE (Transient Elastography), APRI (Aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index), FIB-4 (fibrosis-4 index), the letter two being serum biomarkers. The LightGBM algorithm was coompared to Logistic regression and XGBoost. 	Confidence intervals at 95% for AUROC, statistical significance confirmed for the difference between FibroBox and each of TE, APRI, FIB-4 methods, both for fibrosis and for cyrrhosis predictions.	No.	No.	The run time of FibroBox is mentioned in the Discussion to be only a few seconds.	Precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy,  AUROC.  The latter was used for feature selection, and for comparison with other models.

Data available on request from the corresponding author.	Logistic regression.	No.	Not reported.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard. 	Only 5 predictors available, no selection applied in this work.  The 5 predictors were the result of a selection applied in a previous work (PMID: 21136905), by quantifying differentially expressed proteins in urine proteomes.	Bootstrap cross-validation was used for the internal validation to ensure that overfitting is avoided. Following that, elastic net was used for the regularisation of the coefficients to obtain the final model.  	Yes, use of elastic net.		Logistic Regression is generally considered transparent.  In a previous work (PMID: 26240291) the authors examined the good predicting power of each of the 3 urine biomarkers (LYVE1, REG1A, and TFF1) taken separately.   However, an explaination of the joint effect of the variables has not been attempted.	Binary classification (high PDAC risk or not).		Logistic regression: The “glmnet” package from R was used with elastic net regularisation.    NN: Python packages tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn.  RF: The “party” package from R.   SVM:  The “svmLinear” method from the “caret” package in R was used.  NF: The r-algorithm developed by Shor was used with a precision ε = 0.001. Software implementation of this approach was developed within the Visual Studio 2013 environment.	Independent dataset.		Logistic regression was compared to neural network (NN), neuro-fuzzy technology (NF), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).  None of those additional approaches significantly outperformed logistic regression. 	Inference for the ROC curves was based on cluster-robust standard errors that accounted for the serially correlated nature of the samples. It was not possible to create ROC curves and therefore AUC for RF and SVM since the outcome was not continuous. McNemar’s exact test was used to assess the significance of difference in SN at fixed SP and DeLong’s test was used to assess the significance of differences in AUC between approaches. Confidence intervals (CI 95%) for AUCs were derived based on the DeLong’s method to evaluate the uncertainty of an AUC; SN and SP 95% CI were derived using bootstrap replicates. To allow for multiple testing, both types of tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. 	No.	No.	Not reported.

Harteveld DOC, Grant MR, Pscheidt JW, Peever TL.	Phytopathology	2017	2017	10.1094/phyto-04-17-0162-r		Total dataset composed of 535 in-field observations, N_pos = 84  (presence of spore-realising apothecia) and N_neg = 352 (absence of spore-realising apothecia).  Dataset not previously used.	The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) using the “createDataPartition” function part of the caret package in R (version 3.2.4 for iOS).  Each model was trained with 10-fold cross-validation.    The random splitting of the data, model training, and assessment on the test set were performed 100 times to ascertain the variance of each model due to the random data splitting.	Not applicable.	No.	Four approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF). 	No.	Not reported.	For LR, MARS, RF, the authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.   For ANN, weights can be deduced to have been in the range of 100. Their number depended on the number of nodes in the hidden layer, which was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUROC curve for model assessment.	Exploratory data analyses resulted in removal of correlated predictors (±0.90).   In the end, 7 predictors were used (i.e. 7 types of environmental data -- air temperature, relative humidity, etc).  The “varImp” function contained in the caret package was used to determine the relative predictor importance for each model. Each model was run using 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 predictors. The most important variables were selected for the development of the final model.	Over-fitting in MARS and ANN was discussed and prevented.   In LR and RF, over-fitting should not have been an issue.  Possible underfitting was probabiy there for LR, which, with a kappa of 0.16, indicated a low degree of similarity, between observed and predicted, beyond random chance.	For MARS, the forward stepwise algorithm leads to an overfitted model which is then run through a backward stepwise algorithm where basis functions that contribute the least are removed (Friedman1991).   For RF,  to reduce overfitting, the tree was often pruned, resulting in a smaller tree with fewer splits. This was accomplished using the Gini index, which is a measure of variance across all classes—smaller values mean a more accurate prediction at that node.		No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   LR and MARS are generally considered interpretable models, while ANN and RF are generally considered not interpretable.    Post-hoc feature importance analysis indicated as the most important ones soil moisture, precipitation, and air temperature (LR model), or soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation (MARS, ANN, RF models) -- all of them in line with conclusions found in experimental literature.	Classification (binary prediction).  The continuous output of the LR, MARS, ANN was assigned as 'close to 1' or 'close to 0'.		 Standard algorithms were used. 	Cross-validation.		Four approaches were compared: LR, MARS, ANN, RF.  Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa-metrics, and Brier score.  The best measures were those of RF.	Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa metrics, and Brier score. The AUROC of the RF model was highest at 0.74, significantly higher than LR (with a value of 0.57) but not significantly different from the ANN or MARS models.   LR had a very low kappa value (0.16), while RF had kappa values between 0.43 and 0.57, higher than ANN and MARS values of between 0.35 and 0.5 and, therefore, has the best prediction potential among the four models tested in this study based on the kappa metric.

No.	Not reported.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard. 	f=3.   The feature selection method to distinguish benign from malignant samples consisted of two steps: a LIMMA linear model, and an iterative BMA algorithm.   The R package LIMMA was used  to  select  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes (fold-change cutoff of >=2 and a p-value<0.01). To minimize the number of signature genes, the iterative BMA R package was applied, which accounts for model uncertainty and the dependency between signature genes.    The BMA step was applied to further reduce the number of signature genes from 43 to 3, and thus the costs associated with microarrays and time-consuming data analysis.	 Over- or under- fit could probably be excluded a posteriori by the good predictive performance in independent test sets and novel experiments. 	No.		No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   The model looks to me black box.   Post-hoc interpretability for the ipeptidylprolyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene is supported e.g. by literature reports that this gene significant increases in differentiated carcinomas vs. normal or benign thyroid nodules at average 46 times.   However, the low univariate rankings of 2 of the 3 genes indicated that it was the genes combination, that resulted in good predictive power, and no attempt was made to explain such joint effect.

Arthritis Research & Therapy	2021	2021	10.1186/s13075-021-02567-y		This study used data from the KOBIO registry, which is a nationwide multicenter cohort in Korea that was established to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of biologic therapies in patients with RA [13]. Patients in the registry were recruited from 38 hospitals since 2012, and their demographics, medications, comorbidities, extra-articular manifestations, disease activities, radiographic findings, and laboratory findings performed within 4 weeks prior to the patient’s visit were recorded with the date. The data from patients who were followed up annually were recorded on the KOBIO website (http://www.kobio.or.kr/kobio/), and these patients provided informed consent prior to registration. Ethical approval of the KOBIO-RA was obtained from the institutional review boards of all 38 participating institutions, including the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital (PAIK 2018-11-005).	 the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set		Yes, Data are available from the Clinical Research Committee of KOBIO under the Korean College of Rheumatology for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data	the models included lasso and ridge based on linear relationships [14], support vector machine using kernel methods [15], tree-based random forest [16], and Xgboost	no	Dimension reduction was performed to avoid the “curse of dimensionality” caused by a large number of variables compared with the size of the data. 	a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model	Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if “yes” and 0 if “no” or “no test” because “no” was the most common value.	To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.	no		transparent	classification		na	CV		The no information rate, which is the largest proportion of the observed classes, was used as a baseline to determine the overall distribution of the classification and to compare with those of the machine learning models	na	no	yes, SI	na	Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.

Feature dimensionality was reduced by the mRMR algorithm42 using R package mRMRe. mRMR has been shown to be a robust feature selection algorithm in various tasks43,44,45. The mRMR algorithm was applied to all image features with regard to the class label of sample (i.e., TFE3-RCC or ccRCC) to select an informative and non-redundant set of features.
