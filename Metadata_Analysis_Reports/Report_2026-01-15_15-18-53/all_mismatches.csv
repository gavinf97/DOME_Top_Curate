Shuichiro Makigaki and Takashi Ishida are the primary contributors to this work. They developed a new method for generating pairwise sequence alignments to improve the accuracy of template-based protein structure prediction. Their method involves training a machine learning model using structural alignments of known homologs and dynamically predicting substitution scores during sequence alignment. This approach aims to enhance the accuracy of template-based models, particularly when dealing with remote homologs.

The specific contributions of each author are not detailed. However, it is known that thoracic surgeons with pathological diagnosis expertise collaborated with pathologists to evaluate treatment responses. A radiologist and a thoracic surgeon completed region of interest (ROI) segmentation. Additionally, a senior radiologist assessed the quality of the ROI and made necessary adjustments after the primary radiologist completed tumor lesion segmentation. The FM- LCT model was trained on a diverse dataset encompassing various lung cancer types and stages, using masked autoencoder (MAE) contrastive learning algorithms. The project’s repository on GitHub is attributed to Zhenwei Shi.","Ye G, Wu G, Qi Y, Li K, Wang M, Zhang C, Li F, Wee L, Dekker A, Han C, Liu Z, Liao Y, Shi Z"

Collins and Barton-Maclaren developed novel machine learning models to predict endocrine disruption activity for high-throughput chemical screening. They utilized Random Forest (RF) models to cover a broader range of substances with high predictive capabilities using large datasets from CERAPP and CoMPARA for estrogen and androgen activity, respectively. Their work presents twelve binary and multi-class RF models to predict binding, agonism, and antagonism for estrogen and androgen receptors.

- Peng Chen
- Zhenlei Li
- Zhaolin Hong
- Haoran Zheng
- Rong Zeng

All authors contributed to the development of the robust multiple-datasets-based semi-supervised learning model, MSSL. This model was designed to perform tumor type classification and candidate cancer-specific biomarkers discovery across multiple tumor types and datasets. The authors addressed several long-lasting obstacles in the field, including the insufficient data volume in existing single datasets, the ineffective use of multiple datasets due to inconsistent internal variances and low quality, and the limited impact of relatively uncommon cancers on deep learning methods.

Peng Chen, Zhenlei Li, Zhaolin Hong, and Haoran Zheng are affiliated with the School of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. Additionally, Haoran Zheng is associated with the Anhui Key Laboratory of Software Engineering in Computing and Communication and the Department of Systems Biology at the same university. Rong Zeng is affiliated with the CAS Key Laboratory of Systems Biology at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, as well as the School of Life Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University.

The authors applied MSSL to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) pan-cancer normalized-level3 RNA-seq data, achieving a final classification accuracy of 97.6%. This significant performance leap compared to previous approaches demonstrates the efficacy of their method. The top genes selected through this process were validated to be biologically meaningful for corresponding tumors, with some already in use as biomarkers.","Chen P, Li Z, Hong Z, Zheng H, Zeng R"

Busatto, de Franca, Cyrino, and Paschoal assessed the elimination profile of albendazole residues in fish. Risdon and colleagues investigated the impact of artificial sweeteners on endothelial vascular reactivity in rodents. Zheng, Mi, Li, and Chen determined the presence of xylazine and 2,6-xylidine in animal tissues using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Korunes and colleagues developed a gene expression biomarker for predictive toxicology to identify chemical modulators of NF-kappaB. Lynch and colleagues characterized human pregnane X receptor activators identified from a screening of the Tox21 compound library. Xia and colleagues identified chemical compounds that induce HIF-1α activity. Sun and colleagues predicted cytochrome P450 profiles of environmental chemicals with QSAR models built from drug-like molecules. Attene-Ramos and colleagues profiled the Tox21 chemical collection for mitochondrial function to identify compounds that acutely decrease mitochondrial membrane potential. Xia and colleagues contributed to the identification of chemical compounds that induce HIF-1α activity.","Ye L, Ngan DK, Xu T, Liu Z, Zhao J, Sakamuru S, Zhang L, Zhao T, Xia M, Simeonov A, Huang R"

Their work focuses on the development of an automated approach for the recognition of DNA-binding sites, improving prediction through distance-dependent refinement, and using these predictions to identify DNA-binding proteins. They employed a support vector machines (SVM)-based approach to distinguish DNA-binding residues from non-binding residues using various features such as residue identity, charge, solvent accessibility, average potential, secondary structure, neighboring residues, and location in a cationic patch. The study involved training the SVM model on a set of 50 proteins and testing it on a larger set of 37 proteins, achieving an accuracy of 66% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, they developed a post-processing scheme to further improve prediction accuracy, resulting in an average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of approximately 71.3%, 69.3%, and 70.5%, respectively.","Bhardwaj N, Lu H"
